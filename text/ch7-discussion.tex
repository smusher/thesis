\section{Summary of findings}

David Colquhoun wrote the following in 1998:
"Distinguishing between effects on binding and effects on conformation change is arguably the fundamental problem of modern molecular studies of receptors.
It is not an easy distinction to make, but unless it can be solved, the interpretation of structure‚Äêfunction studies is quite likely to be nonsense." \cite{colquhoun_binding_1998}
