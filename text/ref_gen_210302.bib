	abstract = {The response of ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP) to cellular metabolism is coordinated by three classes of nucleotide binding site (NBS). We used a novel approach involving labeling of intact channels in a native, membrane environment with a non-canonical fluorescent amino acid and measurement (using FRET with fluorescent nucleotides) of steady-state and time-resolved nucleotide binding to dissect the role of NBS2 of the accessory SUR1 subunit of KATP in channel gating. Binding to NBS2 was Mg2+-independent, but Mg2+ was required to trigger a conformational change in SUR1. Mutation of a lysine (K1384A) in NBS2 that coordinates bound nucleotides increased the EC50 for trinitrophenyl-ADP binding to NBS2, but only in the presence of Mg2+, indicating that this mutation disrupts the ligand-induced conformational change. Comparison of nucleotide-binding with ionic currents suggests a model in which each nucleotide binding event to NBS2 of SUR1 is independent and promotes KATP activation by the same amount.},

	abstract = {The ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP channel) couples blood levels of glucose to insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells. KATP channel closure triggers a cascade of events that results in insulin release. Metabolically generated changes in the intracellular concentrations of adenosine nucleotides are integral to this regulation, with ATP and ADP closing the channel and MgATP and MgADP increasing channel activity. Activating mutations in the genes encoding either of the two types of KATP channel subunit (Kir6.2 and SUR1) result in neonatal diabetes mellitus, whereas loss-of-function mutations cause hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia of infancy. Sulfonylurea and glinide drugs, which bind to SUR1, close the channel through a pathway independent of ATP and are now the primary therapy for neonatal diabetes mellitus caused by mutations in the genes encoding KATP channel subunits. Insight into the molecular details of drug and nucleotide regulation of channel activity has been illuminated by cryo-electron microscopy structures that reveal the atomic-level organization of the KATP channel complex. Here we review how these structures aid our understanding of how the various mutations in the genes encoding Kir6.2 (KCNJ11) and SUR1 (ABCC8) lead to a reduction in ATP inhibition and thereby neonatal diabetes mellitus. We also provide an update on known mutations and sulfonylurea therapy in neonatal diabetes mellitus.},

	abstract = {The structure and dynamics of proteins underlies the workings of virtually every biological process. Existing biophysical methods are inadequate to measure protein structure at atomic resolution, on a rapid time scale, with limited amounts of protein, and in the context of a cell or membrane. FRET can measure distances between two probes, but depends on the orientation of the probes and typically works only over long distances comparable with the size of many proteins. Also, common probes used for FRET can be large and have long, flexible attachment linkers that position dyes far from the protein backbone. Here, we improve and extend a fluorescence method called transition metal ion FRET that uses energy transfer to transition metal ions as a reporter of short-range distances in proteins with little orientation dependence. This method uses a very small cysteine-reactive dye monobromobimane, with virtually no linker, and various transition metal ions bound close to the peptide backbone as the acceptor. We show that, unlike larger fluorophores and longer linkers, this donor–acceptor pair accurately reports short-range distances and changes in backbone distances. We further extend the method by using cysteine-reactive metal chelators, which allow the technique to be used in protein regions of unknown secondary structure or when native metal ion binding sites are present. This improved method overcomes several of the key limitations of classical FRET for intramolecular distance measurements.},

	abstract = {Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–sensitive K+ (KATP) channels are molecular sensors of cell metabolism. These hetero-octameric channels, comprising four inward rectifier K+ channel subunits (Kir6.1 or Kir6.2) and four sulfonylurea receptor (SUR1 or SUR2A/B) subunits, detect metabolic changes via three classes of intracellular adenine nucleotide (ATP/ADP) binding site. One site, located on the Kir subunit, causes inhibition of the channel when ATP or ADP is bound. The other two sites, located on the SUR subunit, excite the channel when bound to Mg nucleotides. In pancreatic β cells, an increase in extracellular glucose causes a change in oxidative metabolism and thus turnover of adenine nucleotides in the cytoplasm. This leads to the closure of KATP channels, which depolarizes the plasma membrane and permits Ca2+ influx and insulin secretion. Many of the molecular details regarding the assembly of the KATP complex, and how changes in nucleotide concentrations affect gating, have recently been uncovered by several single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structures of the pancreatic KATP channel (Kir6.2/SUR1) at near-atomic resolution. Here, the author discusses the detailed picture of excitatory and inhibitory ligand binding to KATP that these structures present and suggests a possible mechanism by which channel activation may proceed from the ligand-binding domains of SUR to the channel pore.},

The latter belong to the ATP-binding cassette family of transporters. KATP channels are inhibited by ATP (or ADP) binding to Kir6.2 and activated by Mg-nucleotide interactions with SUR. This dual regulation enables the KATP channel to couple the metabolic state of a cell to its electrical excitability and is crucial for the KATP channel’s role in regulating insulin secretion, cardiac and neuronal excitability, and vascular tone. Here, we review the regulation of the KATP channel by adenine nucleotides and present an equilibrium allosteric model for nucleotide activation and inhibition.

	abstract = {KATP channels act as key regulators of electrical excitability by coupling metabolic cues—mainly intracellular adenine nucleotide concentrations—to cellular potassium ion efflux. However, their study has been hindered by their rapid loss of activity in excised membrane patches (rundown), and by a second phenomenon, the decline of activation by Mg-nucleotides (DAMN). Degradation of PI(4,5)P2 and other phosphoinositides is the strongest candidate for the molecular cause of rundown. Broad evidence indicates that most other determinants of rundown (e.g. phosphorylation, intracellular calcium, channel mutations that affect rundown) also act by influencing KATP channel regulation by phosphoinositides. Unfortunately, experimental conditions that reproducibly prevent rundown have remained elusive, necessitating post hoc data compensation. Rundown is clearly distinct from DAMN. While the former is associated with pore-forming Kir6.2 subunits, DAMN is generally a slower process involving the regulatory sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) subunits. We speculate that it arises when SUR subunits enter non-physiological conformational states associated with the loss of SUR nucleotide-binding domain dimerization following prolonged exposure to nucleotide-free conditions. This review presents new information on both rundown and DAMN, summarizes our current understanding of these processes and considers their physiological roles.This article is part of the themed issue ‘Evolution brings Ca2+ and ATP together to control life and death’.},

Mg-nucleotide binding to SUR1 stimulates KATP. In the absence of Mg2+, SUR1 increases the apparent affinity for nucleotide inhibition at Kir6.2 by an unknown mechanism. We simultaneously measured channel currents and nucleotide binding to Kir6.2. Fits to combined data sets suggest that KATP closes with only one nucleotide molecule bound. A Kir6.2 mutation (C166S) that increases channel activity did not affect nucleotide binding, but greatly perturbed the ability of bound nucleotide to inhibit KATP. Mutations at position K205 in SUR1 affected both nucleotide affinity and the ability of bound nucleotide to inhibit KATP. This suggests a dual role for SUR1 in KATP inhibition, both in directly contributing to nucleotide binding and in stabilising the nucleotide-bound closed state.},

Despite this popularity, or perhaps because of it, most psychologists are not aware of the statistical peculiarities of thep value procedure. In particular,p values are based on data that were never observed, and these hypothetical data are themselves influenced by subjective intentions. Moreover,p values do not quantify statistical evidence. This article reviews thesep value problems and illustrates each problem with concrete examples. The three problems are familiar to statisticians but may be new to psychologists. A practical solution to thesep value problems is to adopt a model selection perspective and use the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for statistical inference (Raftery, 1995). The BIC provides an approximation to a Bayesian hypothesis test, does not require the specification of priors, and can be easily calculated from SPSS output.},

	abstract = {1 ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels are composed of pore-forming (Kir6.x) and regulatory sulphonylurea receptor (SURx) subunits. We have isolated a novel SUR variant (SUR1bΔ33) from a hypothalamic cDNA library. This variant lacked exon 33 and introduced a frameshift that produced a truncated protein lacking the second nucleotide binding domain (NBD2). It was expressed at low levels in hypothalamus, midbrain, heart and the insulin-secreting β-cell line MIN6. 2 We examined the properties of KATP channels composed of Kir6.2 and SUR1bΔ33 by recording macroscopic currents in membrane patches excised from Xenopus oocytes expressing these subunits. We also investigated the effect of truncating SUR1 at either the start (SUR1bT1) or end (SUR1bT2) of exon 33 on KATP channel properties. 3 Kir6.2/SUR1bΔ33 showed an enhanced open probability (Po= 0.6 at -60 mV) and a reduced ATP sensitivity (Ki, 86 μm), when compared with wild-type channels (Po= 0.3; Ki, 22 μm). However, Kir6.2/SUR1bT1 and Kir6.2/SUR1bT2 resembled the wild-type channel in their Po and ATP sensitivity. 4 Neither MgADP, nor the K+ channel opener diazoxide, enhanced Kir6.2/SUR1bΔ33, Kir6.2/SUR1bT1 or Kir6.2/SUR1bT2 currents, consistent with the idea that these agents require an intact NBD2 for their action. Sulphonylureas blocked KATP channels containing any of the three SUR variants, but in excised patches the extent of block was less than that for the wild-type channel. In intact cells, the extent of sulphonylurea block of Kir6.2/SUR1bΔ33 was greater than that in excised patches and was comparable to that found for wild-type channels. 5 Our results demonstrate that NBD2 is not essential for functional expression or sulphonylurea block, but is required for KATP channel activation by K+ channel openers and nucleotides. Some of the unusual properties of Kir6.2/SUR1bΔ33 resemble those reported for the KATP channel of ventromedial hypothalamic (VMH) neurones, but the fact that this mRNA is expressed at low levels in many other tissues makes it less likely that SUR1bΔ33 serves as the SUR subunit for the VMH KATP channel.},

The activity of the K$_{\textrm{ATP}}$ channel, composed of SUR1 and Kir6.2 subunits, is regulated by intracellular ATP and ADP, but the molecular mechanism is not clear. To distinguish the ATP binding properties of the two nucleotide-binding folds (NBFs) of SUR1, we prepared antibodies against NBF1 and NBF2, and the tryptic fragment of SUR1 was immunoprecipitated after photoaffinity labeling with 8-azido-[$^{\textrm{32}}$P]ATP. The 35-kDa fragment was strongly labeled with 5 μm 8-azido-[$^{\textrm{32}}$P]ATP even in the absence of Mg$^{\textrm{2+}}$ and was immunoprecipitated with the antibody against NBF1. The 65-kDa fragment labeled with 100 μm 8-azido-[α-$^{\textrm{32}}$P]ATP in the presence of Mg$^{\textrm{2+}}$ was immunoprecipitated with anti-NBF2 and anti-C terminus antibodies. These results indicate that NBF1 of SUR1 binds 8-azido-ATP strongly in a magnesium-independent manner and that NBF2 binds 8-azido-ATP weakly in a magnesium-dependent manner. Furthermore, the 65-kDa tryptic fragment was not photoaffinity-labeled with 8-azido-[γ-$^{\textrm{32}}$P]ATP at 37 °C, whereas the 35-kDa tryptic fragment was, suggesting that NBF2 of SUR1 may have ATPase activity and that NBF1 has none or little.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The mechanism of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel closure by ATP is unclear, and various kinetic models in which ATP binds to open or to closed states have previously been presented. Effects of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) and multiple Kir6.2 mutations on ATP inhibition and open probability in the absence of ATP are explainable in kinetic models where ATP stabilizes a closed state and interaction with an open state is not required. Evidence that ATP can in fact interact with the open state of the channel is presented here. The mutant Kir6.2[L164C] is very sensitive to Cd2+ block, but very insensitive to ATP, with no significant inhibition in 1mM ATP. However, 1mM ATP fully protects the channel from Cd2+ block. Allosteric kinetic models in which the channel can be in either open or closed states with or without ATP bound are considered. Such models predict a pedestal in the ATP inhibition, i.e., a maximal amount of inhibition at saturating ATP concentrations. This pedestal is predicted to occur at {\textgreater}50mM ATP in the L164C mutant, but at {\textgreater}1mM in the double mutant L164C/R176A. As predicted, ATP inhibits Kir6.2[L164C/R176A] to a maximum of ∼40\%, with a clear plateau beyond 2mM. These results indicate that ATP acts as an allosteric ligand, interacting with both open and closed states of the channel.},

These channels are heteromultimers composed with a 4:4 stoichiometry of an inwardly rectifying K+ channel subunit (Kir6.2) plus a regulatory sulfonylurea receptor. To elucidate stoichiometry of ATP(4-) action, we analyzed ATP(4-) sensitivity of channels coassembled from wild-type Kir6.2 and a loss of ATP(4-) sensitivity mutant (G334D). Concentration-inhibition curves for cDNA ratios of 1:1 or 1:10 resembled those for channel block resulting from interaction with 1 of 4 sites, whereas models for inhibition requiring occupation of 2, 3, or 4 sites were incongruous. Random assembly of wild-type Kir6.2 with the G334D mutant was confirmed by controls, which assessed the effect of an additional mutation that induced strong rectification (N160D). We conclude 4 identical noncooperative ATP(4-) sites to be grouped within 1 KATP channel complex, with occupation of 1 site being sufficient to induce channel closure. This architecture might facilitate coupling of [ATP(4-)] to insulin secretion and may protect against diabetic dysregulation resulting from heterozygous mutations in Kir6.2.},

Although electrophysiological studies provide clues to the complex control of KATP channels by ATP, MgADP, and pharmacological agents, the molecular mechanism of KATP-channel regulation remains unclear. The KATP channel is a heterooligomeric complex of SUR1 subunits of the ATP-binding-cassette superfamily with two nucleotide-binding folds (NBF1 and NBF2) and the pore-forming Kir6.2 subunits. Here, we report that MgATP and MgADP, but not the Mg salt of γ-thio-ATP, stabilize the binding of prebound 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP to SUR1. Mutation in the Walker A and B motifs of NBF2 of SUR1 abolished this stabilizing effect of MgADP. These results suggest that SUR1 binds 8-azido-ATP strongly at NBF1 and that MgADP, either by direct binding to NBF2 or by hydrolysis of bound MgATP at NBF2, stabilizes prebound 8-azido-ATP binding at NBF1. The sulfonylurea glibenclamide caused release of prebound 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP from SUR1 in the presence of MgADP or MgATP in a concentration-dependent manner. This direct biochemical evidence of cooperative interaction in nucleotide binding of the two NBFs of SUR1 suggests that glibenclamide both blocks this cooperative binding of ATP and MgADP and, in cooperation with the MgADP bound at NBF2, causes ATP to be released from NBF1.},

This method exploits the fact that the probability of the energy transfer is related to the separation between the fluorescent molecules. This relationship is well described for a single pair of fluorophores but is complicated in systems containing more than two fluorophores. Here, we present a Monte Carlo calculation scheme that has been implemented through a user-friendly web-based program called ExiFRET that can be used to determine the FRET efficiency in a wide range of fluorophore arrangements. ExiFRET is useful to model FRET for individual fluorophores randomly distributed in two or three dimensions, fluorophores linked in pairs or arranged in regular geometries with or without predefined stoichiometries. ExiFRET can model both uniform distributions and fluorophores that are aggregated in clusters. We demonstrate how this tool can be employed to understand the effect of labeling efficiency on FRET efficiency, estimate relative contributions of inter- and intramolecular FRET, investigate the structure of multimeric proteins, stoichiometries, and oligomers, and to aid experiments studying the aggregation of lipids and proteins in membrane environments. We also present an extension that can be used to study instances in which fluorophores have constrained orientations.},

Binding of this analogue substrate to the enzyme is characterized by a 9-fold enhancement in probe fluorescence. Saturating levels of the feedback inhibitor, threonine, produce a 77\% increase in fluorescence enhancement, indicating an increase in the rigidity or hydrophobicity of the nucleotide-binding site in the inhibited form of the enzyme. Threonine titration studies indicate that the two inhibitor-binding sites found on each subunit do not contribute equally to the fluorescence-detected conformational change. Comparison of the spectral change with the inhibition of dehydrogenase activity has revealed the exclusive involvement of the non-kinase threonine sites. No transition can be detected as a consequence of inhibitor binding at the kinase subsites. The results of the 2'(3')-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5'-triphosphate study have provided further evidence for a concerted kinase-dehydrogenase conformational change which is induced by threonine interaction with the high affinity binding sites and which provides maximal inhibition of homoserine dehydrogenase and the majority of aspartokinase inhibition. The failure to observe a distinct enzyme form produced by threonine occupation of the low affinity kinase sites suggests that no large structural reorganization of the kinase active site is produced as a result of this binding event. The conformational change, suggested by the cooperativity of threonine binding, must instead involve only a subtle or highly localized alteration which does not perturb the environment of the ATP-binding cleft.},

Nevertheless, one can increase the probability of successful crystallization by precrystallization screening, a process by which one analyzes the monodispersity and stability of the protein-detergent complex. Traditionally, this has required microgram to milligram quantities of purified protein and a concomitant investment of time and resources. Here, we describe a rapid and efficient precrystallization screening strategy in which the target protein is covalently fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the resulting unpurified protein is analyzed by fluorescence-detection size-exclusion chromatography (FSEC). This strategy requires only nanogram quantities of unpurified protein and allows one to evaluate localization and expression level, the degree of monodispersity, and the approximate molecular mass. We show the application of this precrystallization screening to four membrane proteins derived from prokaryotic or eukaryotic organisms.},

Fluorescence signals were reliably observed when fluorophore was covalently attached to a site between the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain and the pore. While iodide, an anionic quencher, has a higher quenching efficiency in the channel's closed state, thallium ion, a cationic quencher, has a higher quenching efficiency in the open state.

The absence of ATP evoked a large additional K+ conductance. In cell-attached patches single K+-channels were observed in the absence of glucose. Adition of glucose (20 mM) to the bath suppressed the channel activity and initiated action potentials. Similar single-channel currents were recorded from isolated patches. In this case the channels were reversibly blocked by adding ATP (3 mM) to the solution at the intracellular side of the membrane. The conductances (51 pS and 56 pS for [K+]0=145 mM, T=21° C) and kinetics (at −70 mV: τopen=2.2 ms and τclosed=0.38 ms and 0.33 ms) of the glucose- and ATP-dependent channels were found to be very similar.

It is well established that glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is associated with the appearance of electrical activity in the β-cell1,2; glucose concentrations above the threshold level for insulin release produce a slow membrane depolarization followed by either oscillatory bursts of action potentials (5–15 mM glucose) or continuous spiking ({\textgreater}16mM glucose). Tracer flux studies3 and microelectrode measurements using intact islets of Langerhans4 have indicated that the initial depolarization induced by glucose is caused by a decrease in the resting membrane permeability to potassium. Evidence also suggests that the electrical5, ionic6 and secretory responses7,8 to glucose are mediated by the metabolism of the sugar within the β-cell. By using cell-attached membrane patches9 from isolated rat pancreatic β-cells, we have now identified a potassium channel (G-channel) that is active at the resting potential and is inhibited by glucose. Closure of this channel requires glucose metabolism. This is the first report of a potassium channel whose activity is modulated by glucose, and which may couple metabolic and ionic events involved in the secretion of insulin.},

All tagged constructs generated functional channels with essentially normal properties when coexpressed with the relevant other subunit. GFP-tagged Kir6.2 (Kir6.2-GFP) showed perinuclear and plasma membrane fluorescence patterns when expressed alone or with SUR1, and a very similar pattern was observed when channel-forming SUR1-Kir6.2-GFP was expressed on its own. In contrast, whereas SUR1 (SUR1-GFP) also showed a perinuclear and plasma membrane fluorescence pattern when expressed alone, an apparently cytoplasmic fluorescence was observed when coexpressed with Kir6.2 subunits. The results indicate that Kir6.2 subunits traffic to the plasma membrane in the presence or absence of SUR1, in contradiction to the hypothesis that homomeric Kir6.2 channels are not observed because SUR1 is required as a chaperone to guide Kir6.2 subunits through the secretory pathway.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Choline potentiates the depolarizing effect of acetylcholine (Ach) when applied in normal Ringer. Decamethonium has a ‘diphasic’ action, initial depression of the Ach effect being followed by more prolonged potentiation. When these experiments are made after treating the muscle with an esterase inhibitor (prostigmine 10-6 w/v), the potentiation of the Ach effect, by decamethonium or choline, is absent and replaced by simple ‘curare-like’ inhibition. When decamethonium is allowed to interact with a rapidly acting stable ester (carbaminoylcholine or succinylcholine), it produces simple 'curare-like’ inhibition. The triple effects of choline and decamethonium, i. e. (i) weak depolarization, (ii) potentiation of Ach in normal Ringer solution, (iii) inhibition of Ach in the presence of prostigmine, can be explained by competitive reactions between the drugs and receptor as well as Ach-esterase molecules.

MgADP and diazoxide interact with SUR1 to promote channel activity. 2 We examined the effect of N-terminal deletions of Kir6.2 on the channel open probability, ATP sensitivity and sulphonylurea sensitivity by recording macroscopic currents in membrane patches excised from Xenopus oocytes expressing wild-type or mutant Kir6.2/SUR1. 3 A 14 amino acid N-terminal deletion (ΔN14) did not affect the gating, ATP sensitivity or tolbutamide block of a truncated isoform of Kir6.2, Kir6.2ΔC26, expressed in the absence of SUR1. Thus, the N-terminal deletion does not alter the intrinsic properties of Kir6.2. 4 When Kir6.2ΔN14 was coexpressed with SUR1, the resulting KATP channels had a higher open probability (Po= 0·7) and a lower ATP sensitivity (Ki= 196 μM) than wild-type (Kir6.2/SUR1) channels (Po= 0·32, Ki= 28 μM). High-affinity tolbutamide block was also abolished. 5 Truncation of five or nine amino acids from the N-terminus of Kir6.2 also enhanced the open probability, and reduced both the ATP sensitivity and the fraction of high-affinity tolbutamide block, although to a lesser extent than for the ΔN14 deletion. Site-directed mutagenesis suggests that hydrophobic residues in Kir6.2 may be involved in this effect. 6 The reduced ATP sensitivity of Kir6.2ΔN14 may be explained by the increased Po. However, when the Po was decreased (by ATP), tolbutamide was unable to block Kir6.2ΔN14/SUR1-K719A,K1385M currents, despite the fact that the drug inhibited Kir6.2-C166S/SUR1-K719A,K1385M currents (which in the absence of ATP have a Po of {\textgreater} 0·8 and are not blocked by tolbutamide). Thus the N-terminus of Kir6.2 may be involved in coupling sulphonylurea binding to SUR1 to closure of the Kir6.2 pore.},

This inhibition plays a crucial role in the coupling of electrical activity to energy metabolism in a variety of cells. The KATP channel is formed from four each of a sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) regulatory subunit and an inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir6.2) pore-forming subunit. We used systematic chimeric and point mutagenesis, combined with patch-clamp recording, to investigate the molecular basis of ATP-dependent inhibition gating of mouse pancreatic β cell KATP channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. We identified distinct functional domains of the presumed cytoplasmic C-terminal segment of the Kir6.2 subunit that play an important role in this inhibition. Our results suggest that one domain is associated with inhibitory ATP binding and another with gate closure.},

We suggest that these MRP-related proteins are also characterized by a special, common membrane topology pattern. The most studied ABC transporters, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and the multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins, were shown to contain a tandem repeat of six transmembrane helices, each set followed by an ATP-binding domain. According to the present study, in contrast to various membrane topology predictions proposed for the different MRP-related proteins, they all seem to have a CFTR/MDR-like core structure, and an additional, large, N-terminal hydrophobic region. This latter domain is predicted to contain 4–6 (most probably 5) transmembrane helices, and is occasionally glycosylated on the cell surface. Since all the MRP-related transporters were shown to interact with anionic compounds, the N-terminal membrane-bound domain may have a key role in these interactions.},

SUR proteins are members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of proteins. Binding of MgATP at the SUR nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) results in NBD dimerization, and hydrolysis of MgATP at the NBDs leads to channel opening. The SUR proteins also mediate interactions with KATP channel openers (KCOs) that activate the channel, with KCO binding and/or activation involving residues in the transmembrane helices and cytoplasmic loops of the SUR proteins. Because the cytoplasmic loops make extensive interactions with the NBDs, we hypothesized that the NBDs may also be involved in KCO binding. Here, we report nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy studies that demonstrate a specific interaction of the KCO pinacidil with the first nucleotide binding domain (NBD1) from SUR2A, the regulatory SUR protein in cardiac KATP channels. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence titrations also demonstrate binding of pinacidil to SUR2A NBD1, and fluorescent nucleotide binding studies show that pinacidil binding increases the affinity of SUR2A NBD1 for ATP. In contrast, the KCO diazoxide does not interact with SUR2A NBD1 under the same conditions. NMR relaxation experiments and size exclusion chromatography indicate that SUR2A NBD1 is monomeric under the conditions used in drug binding studies. These studies identify additional binding sites for commonly used KCOs and provide a foundation for testing binding of drugs to the SUR NBDs.},

Here, we have characterized the nucleotide-binding protein (OpuAA) of the B.subtilis OpuA transporter in vitro. OpuAA was overexpressed heterologously in Escherichia coli as a hexahistidine tag fusion protein and purified to homogeneity by affinity and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Dynamic monomer/dimer equilibrium was observed for OpuAA, and the KD value was determined to be 6 μM. Under high ionic strength assay conditions, the monomer/dimer interconversion was diminished, which enabled separation of both species by SEC and separate analysis of both monomeric and dimeric OpuAA. In the presence of 1 M NaCl, monomeric OpuAA showed a basal ATPase activity (KM=0.45 mM; k2=2.3 min−1), whereas dimeric OpuAA showed little ATPase activity under this condition. The addition of nucleotides influenced the monomer/dimer ratio of OpuAA, demonstrating different oligomeric states during its catalytic cycle. The monomer was the preferred species under post-hydrolysis conditions (e.g. ADP/Mg2+), whereas the dimer dominated the nucleotide-free and ATP-bound states. The affinity and stoichiometry of monomeric or dimeric OpuAA/ATP complexes were determined by means of the fluorescent ATP-analog TNP–ATP. One molecule of TNP–ATP was bound in the monomeric state and two TNP–ATP molecules were detected in the dimeric state of OpuAA. Binding of TNP–ADP/Mg2+ to dimeric OpuAA induced a conformational change that led to the decay of the dimer. On the basis of our data, we propose a model that couples changes in the oligomeric state of OpuAA with ATP hydrolysis.},

Pinacidil activates channels containing SUR2A (heart, skeletal muscle), but not those containing SUR1 (β cells). Surprisingly, binding of the pinacidil analog [3H]P1075 is dependent on added nucleotides, yet in electrophysiological studies, pinacidil is effective in the absence of intracellular nucleotides. To determine the reason for this anomaly, we examined the functional interactions between pinacidil (or P1075) and nucleotides by expressing cloned Kir6.2/SUR2A channels in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Both pinacidil and P1075 activated macroscopic Kir6.2/SUR2A currents in the absence of added nucleotide, but the presence of intracellular ATP or ADP slowed the off-rate of the response. Mutation of the Walker A lysine in a single nucleotide binding domain (NBD) of SUR2A (K707A in NBD1, K1348A in NBD2), abolished this action of nucleotide. The K1348A mutation prevented stimulation by MgADP but had little effect on the amplitude of the pinacidil response. In contrast, Kir6.2/SUR2A-K707A currents were activated by MgADP, but only responded to pinacidil in the presence of Mg-nucleotide. Off-rates in the absence (or presence) of nucleotide were slower for the pinacidil analog P1075 than for pinacidil, consistent with the higher affinity of P1075. We suggest that slowing of P1075 dissociation by nucleotide enables binding to be detected.},

When bound to heavy meromyosin, TNP-ATP underwent the characteristic spectral shift. The difference spectrum resulting from the binding of TNP-ATP to heavy meromyosin at pH 8.0 had positive peaks at 415 nm and 518 nm, and a negative trough at 458 nm. The difference spectrum due to the binding of 2′(or 3′)-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine (TNP-adenosine) to heavy meromyosin had small positive peaks at 420 nm and 495 nm. This difference spectrum was similar to that of TNP-ATP or TNP-adenosine produced by 20\% (v/v) ethyleneglycol perturbation. The positive peak at 495 nm in the difference spectrum due to the binding of TNP-adenosine to heavy meromyosin shifted toward 505 nm, when pyrophosphate or ATP was added to the reaction mixture. These results suggest that the difference spectrum of TNP-ATP due to the interaction with heavy meromyosin arises not only from the binding of the chromophoric portion of the TNP-ATP molecule but also from that of the phosphate portion.},

Structurally, CNG channels are heterotetramers composed of either two or three homologue subunits1,2,3,4. Although it is well established that activation is a cooperative process of these subunits5, it remains unknown whether the cooperativity is generated by the ligand binding, the gating, or both, and how the subunits interact. In this study, the action of homotetrameric olfactory-type CNGA2 channels6 was studied in inside-out membrane patches by simultaneously determining channel activation and ligand binding, using the fluorescent cGMP analogue 8-DY547-cGMP as the ligand. At concentrations of 8-DY547-cGMP {\textless} 1 μM, steady-state binding was larger than steady-state activation, whereas at higher concentrations it was smaller, generating a crossover of the steady-state relationships. Global analysis of these relationships together with multiple activation time courses following cGMP jumps7 showed that four ligands bind to the channels and that there is significant interaction between the binding sites. Among the binding steps, the second is most critical for channel opening: its association constant is three orders of magnitude smaller than the others and it triggers a switch from a mostly closed to a maximally open state. These results contribute to unravelling the role of the subunits in the cooperative mechanism of CNGA2 channel activation and could be of general relevance for the action of other ion channels and receptors.},

These channels play crucial roles in many essential physiological processes and have been implicated extensively in a spectrum of metabolic diseases and disorders. To gain insight into the mechanism of KATP, we elucidated the structure of a hetero-octameric pancreatic KATP channel in complex with a non-competitive inhibitor glibenclamide by single-particle cryoelectron microscopy to 5.6-Å resolution. The structure shows that four SUR1 regulatory subunits locate peripherally and dock onto the central Kir6.2 channel tetramer through the SUR1 TMD0-L0 fragment. Glibenclamide-bound SUR1 uses TMD0-L0 fragment to stabilize Kir6.2 channel in a closed conformation. In another structural population, a putative co-purified phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) molecule uncouples Kir6.2 from glibenclamide-bound SUR1. These structural observations suggest a molecular mechanism for KATP regulation by anti-diabetic sulfonylurea drugs, intracellular adenosine nucleotide concentrations, and PIP2 lipid.},

Coexpression of βα polypeptides with α monomers inhibited the K+ currents, while coexpression with β monomers did not. We then constructed another single polypeptide (βα2) consisting of a β subunit and a dimeric repeat of the α subunit. 86Rb+ efflux from COS1 cells expressing βα2 polypeptides was small, but was restored by supplementation with β monomers. These results indicate that the activity of KATP channels is optimized when the α and β subunits are coexpressed with a molar ratio of 1:1. Since inward rectifier K+ channels are thought to function as homo- or hetero-tetramers, this suggests that the KATP channel functions as a multimeric protein, most likely a hetero-octamer composed of a tetramer of the Kir6.2 subunit and a tetramer of the SUR1 subunit.},

To understand subunit stoichiometry for the ATP-dependent channel gating, we constructed tandem-multimeric Kir6.2 channels by selective disruption of the binding or gating mechanism in certain subunits. Stepwise disruptions of channel gating caused graded losses in ATP sensitivity and increases in basal Popen, with no effect on maximum ATP inhibition. Prevention of ATP binding lowered the ATP sensitivity and maximum inhibition without affecting basal Popen. The ATP-dependent gating required a minimum of two functional subunits. Two adjacent subunits are more favorable for ATP binding than two diagonal ones. Subunits showed negative cooperativity in ATP binding and positive cooperativity in channel gating. Joint disruptions of the binding and gating mechanisms in the same or alternate subunits of a concatemer revealed that both intra- and intersubunit couplings contributed to channel gating, although the binding-gating coupling preferred the intrasubunit to intersubunit configuration within the C terminus. No such preference was found between the C and N termini. These phenomena are well-described with the operational model used widely for ligand-receptor interactions.},

	abstract = {In pancreatic β cells, insulin secretion is tightly controlled by the cells’ metabolic state via the ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel. ATP is a key mediator in this signaling process, where its role as an inhibitor of KATP channels has been extensively studied. Since the channel contains an ATPase as an accessory subunit, the possibility that ATP hydrolysis mediates KATP channel opening has also been proposed. However, a rigorous test of coupling between ATP hydrolysis and channel gating has not previously been performed. In the present work, we examine whether KATP channel gating obeys detailed balance in order to determine whether ATP hydrolysis is strongly coupled to the gating of the KATP channel. Single-channel records were obtained from inside-out patches of transiently transfected HEK-293 cells. Channel activity in membrane patches with exactly one channel shows no violations of microscopic reversibility. Although KATP channel gating shows long closed times on the time scale where ATP hydrolysis takes place, the time symmetry of channel gating indicates that it is not tightly coupled to ATP hydrolysis. This lack of coupling suggests that channel gating operates close to equilibrium; although detailed balance is not expected to hold for ATP hydrolysis, it still does so in channel gating. On the basis of these results, the function of the ATPase active site in channel gating may be to sense nucleotides by differential binding of ATP and ADP, rather than to drive a thermodynamically unfavorable conformational change.},

	abstract = {1 We have examined the mechanism by which nucleotides modulate the tolbutamide block of the β-cell ATP-sensitive K+ channel (KATP channel), using wild-type and mutant KATP channels heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. This channel is composed of sulphonylurea receptor (SUR1) and pore-forming (Kir6.2) subunits. 2 The dose–response relation for tolbutamide block of wild-type KATP currents in the absence of nucleotide showed both a high-affinity (Ki=2.0 μm) and a low-affinity (Ki=1.8 mm) site. 3 The dose–response relation for tolbutamide block of Kir6.2ΔC36 (a truncated form of Kir6.2 which is expressed independently of SUR1) was best fitted with a single, low-affinity site (Ki=1.7 mm). This indicates that the high-affinity site resides on SUR1, whereas the low-affinity site is located on Kir6.2. 4 ADP (100 μM) had a dual effect on wild-type KATP currents: the nucleotide enhanced the current in the presence of Mg2+, but was inhibitory in the absence of Mg2+. Kir6.2ΔC36 currents were blocked by 100 μM ADP in the presence of Mg2+. 5 For wild-type KATP currents, the blocking effect of 0.5 mm tolbutamide appeared greater in the presence of 100 μm MgADP (84 ± 2\%) than in its absence (59 ± 4\%). When SUR1 was mutated to abolish MgADP activation of KATP currents (K719A or K1384M), there was no difference in the extent of tolbutamide inhibition in the presence or absence of MgADP. 6 The ki for tolbutamide interaction with either the high- or low-affinity site was unaffected by 100 μM MgADP, for both wild-type and K719A-K1384M currents. 7 MgGDP (100μM) enhanced wild-type KATP currents and was without effect on K719A– K1384M currents. It did not affect the ki for tolbutamide block at either the high- or low-affinity site. 8 Our results indicate that interaction of tolbutamide with the high-affinity site (on SUR1) abolishes the stimulatory action of MgADP. This unmasks the inhibitory effect of ADP and leads to an apparent increase in channel inhibition. Under physiological conditions, abolition of MgADP activation is likely to constitute the principal mechanism by which tolbutamide inhibits the KATP channel.},

They are also the target for clinically important drugs such as sulphonylureas, which stimulate secretion, and the K+ channel opener diazoxide, which inhibits insulin release3,4. Metabolic regulation of K-ATP channels is mediated by changes in intracellular ATP and Mg-ADP levels, which inhibit and activate the channel, respectively2. The β-cell K-ATP channel is a complex of two proteins5,6: an inward-rectifier K+ channel subunit, Kir6.2, and the sulphonylurea receptor, SUR1. We show here that the primary site at which ATP acts to mediate K-ATP channel inhibition is located on Kir6.2, and that SUR1 is required for sensitivity to sulphonylureas and diazoxide and for activation by Mg-ADP.},

In the case of ABC-ATPases, application of these powerful tools has been greatly restricted due to the significantly higher affinity of the TNP-nucleotide for the corresponding ABC-ATPase in comparison to the non-modified nucleotides. To understand the molecular changes occurring upon binding of the TNP-nucleotide to an ABC-ATPase, we have determined the crystal structure of the TNP–ADP/HlyB–NBD complex at 1.6Å resolution. Despite the higher affinity of TNP–ADP, no direct fluorophore–protein interactions were observed. Unexpectedly, only water-mediated interactions were detected between the TNP moiety and Tyr477, that is engaged in π–π stacking with the adenine ring, as well as with two serine residues (Ser504 and Ser509) of the Walker A motif. Interestingly, the side chains of these two serine residues adopt novel conformations that are not observed in the corresponding ADP structure. However, in the crystal structure of the S504A mutant, which binds TNP–ADP with similar affinity to the wild type enzyme, a novel TNP–water interaction compensates for the missing serine side chain. Since this water molecule is not present in the wild type enzyme, these results suggest that only water-mediated interactions provide a structural explanation for the increased affinity of TNP-nucleotides towards ABC-ATPases. However, our results also imply that in silico approaches such as docking or modeling cannot directly be applied to generate ‘affinity-adopted’ ADP- or ATP-analogs for ABC-ATPases.},

The healthy β-cell acts as a glucose sensor matching its output to the circulating glucose concentration.

Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of the β-cell transcriptome, electrical activity, and insulin exocytosis. We highlight salient differences between mouse and human β-cells, provide models of how the different ion channels contribute to their electrical activity and insulin secretion, and conclude by discussing how these processes become perturbed in T2DM.},

	abstract = {Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–sensitive K+ (KATP) channels are molecular sensors of cell metabolism. These hetero-octameric channels, comprising four inward rectifier K+ channel subunits (Kir6.1 or Kir6.2) and four sulfonylurea receptor (SUR1 or SUR2A/B) subunits, detect metabolic changes via three classes of intracellular adenine nucleotide (ATP/ADP) binding site. One site, located on the Kir subunit, causes inhibition of the channel when ATP or ADP is bound. The other two sites, located on the SUR subunit, excite the channel when bound to Mg nucleotides. In pancreatic β cells, an increase in extracellular glucose causes a change in oxidative metabolism and thus turnover of adenine nucleotides in the cytoplasm. This leads to the closure of KATP channels, which depolarizes the plasma membrane and permits Ca2+ influx and insulin secretion. Many of the molecular details regarding the assembly of the KATP complex, and how changes in nucleotide concentrations affect gating, have recently been uncovered by several single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structures of the pancreatic KATP channel (Kir6.2/SUR1) at near-atomic resolution. Here, the author discusses the detailed picture of excitatory and inhibitory ligand binding to KATP that these structures present and suggests a possible mechanism by which channel activation may proceed from the ligand-binding domains of SUR to the channel pore.},

The activity of these channels is primarily determined by intracellular adenosine nucleotides, which have both inhibitory and stimulatory effects. The role of KATP channels has been studied most extensively in pancreatic beta-cells, where they link glucose metabolism to insulin secretion. Many mutations in KATP channel subunits (Kir6.2, SUR1) have been identified that cause either neonatal diabetes or congenital hyperinsulinism. Thus, a mechanistic understanding of KATP channel behavior is necessary for modeling beta-cell electrical activity and insulin release in both health and disease. Here, we review recent advances in the KATP channel structure and function. We focus on the molecular mechanisms of KATP channel gating by adenosine nucleotides, phospholipids and sulphonylureas and consider the advantages and limitations of various mathematical models of macroscopic and single-channel KATP currents. Finally, we outline future directions for the development of more realistic models of KATP channel gating.},

These studies have revealed numerous and important differences between human and rodent β cells. Here we discuss the properties of human pancreatic β cells: their glucose sensing, the ion channel complement underlying glucose-induced electrical activity that culminates in exocytotic release of insulin, the cellular control of exocytosis, and the modulation of insulin secretion by circulating hormones and locally released neurotransmitters. Finally, we consider the pathophysiology of insulin secretion and the interactions between genetics and environmental factors that may explain the current diabetes epidemic.},

The activation of human inward rectifying potassium (hKir) channels by phosphoinositides (PI) has been well characterised. Here, we apply a coarse-grained molecular dynamics free-energy perturbation (CG-FEP) protocol to capture the energetics of binding of PI lipids to hKir channels. By using either a single- or multi-step approach, we establish a consistent value for the binding of PIP2 to hKir channels, relative to the binding of the bulk phosphatidylcholine phospholipid. Furthermore, by perturbing amino acid side chains on hKir6.2, we show that the neonatal diabetes mutation E179K increases PIP2 affinity, while the congenital hyperinsulinism mutation K67N results in a reduced affinity. We show good agreement with electrophysiological data where E179K exhibits a reduction in neomycin sensitivity, implying that PIP2 binds more tightly E179K channels. This illustrates the application of CG-FEP to compare affinities between lipid species, and for annotating amino acid residues.},

	abstract = {Functional integrity of pancreatic adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels depends on the interactions between the pore-forming potassium channel subunit Kir6.2 and the regulatory subunit sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1). Previous studies have shown that the N-terminal transmembrane domain of SUR1 (TMD0) interacts with Kir6.2 and is sufficient to confer high intrinsic open probability (Po) and bursting patterns of activity observed in full-length KATP channels. However, the nature of TMD0–Kir6.2 interactions that underlie gating modulation is not well understood. Using two previously described disease-causing mutations in TMD0 (R74W and E128K), we performed amino acid substitutions to study the structural roles of these residues in KATP channel function in the context of full-length SUR1 as well as TMD0. Our results revealed that although R74W and E128K in full-length SUR1 both decrease surface channel expression and reduce channel sensitivity to ATP inhibition, they arrive there via distinct mechanisms. Mutation of R74 uniformly reduced TMD0 protein levels, suggesting that R74 is necessary for stability of TMD0. In contrast, E128 mutations retained TMD0 protein levels but reduced functional coupling between TMD0 and Kir6.2 in mini-KATP channels formed by TMD0 and Kir6.2. Importantly, E128K full-length channels, despite having a greatly reduced Po, exhibit little response to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) stimulation. This is reminiscent of Kir6.2 channel behavior in the absence of SUR1 and suggests that TMD0 controls Kir6.2 gating by modulating Kir6.2 interactions with PIP2. Further supporting this notion, the E128W mutation in full-length channels resulted in channel inactivation that was prevented or reversed by exogenous PIP2. These results identify a critical determinant in TMD0 that controls Kir6.2 gating by controlling channel sensitivity to PIP2. Moreover, they uncover a novel mechanism of KATP channel inactivation involving aberrant functional coupling between SUR1 and Kir6.2.},

Interaction of adenine nucleotides with Kir6.2 positively charged amino acids such as K185 and R201 on the C-terminus causes channel closure. Substitution of these amino acids with other positively charged residues had small effects on inhibition by adenine nucleotide, while substitution with neutral or negative residues had major effects, suggesting electrostatic interactions between Kir6.2 positive charges and adenine nucleotide negative phosphate groups. Furthermore, R201 mutation decreased channel sensitivity to ATP, ADP, and AMP to a similar extent, but K185 mutation decreased primarily ATP and ADP sensitivity, leaving the AMP sensitivity relatively unaffected. Thus, channel inhibition by ATP may involve interaction of the α-phosphate with R201 and interaction of the β-phosphate with K185. In addition, decreased open probability due to rundown or sulfonylureas caused an increase in ATP sensitivity in the K185 mutant, but not in the R201 mutant. Thus, the β-phosphate may bind in a state-independent fashion to K185 to destabilize channel openings, while R201 interacts with the α-phosphate to stabilize a channel closed configuration. Substitution of R192 on the C-terminus and R50 on the N-terminus with different charged residues also affected ATP sensitivity. Based on these results a structural scheme is proposed, which includes features of other recently published models.},

	abstract = {KATP channels are a functional complex of sulphonylurea receptor (SUR1, SUR2) and inward rectifier K+ (Kir6.1, Kir6.2) channel subunits. We have studied the role of the putative pore forming subunit (Kir6.2) in regulation of rectification and gating of KATP channels generated by transfection of SUR1 and Kir6.2 cDNAs in COSm6 cells. In the absence of internal polyvalent cations, the current-voltage relationship is sigmoidal. Mg2+ or spermine4+ (spm) each induces a mild inward rectification. Mutation of the asparagine at position 160 in Kir6.2 to aspartate (N160D) or glutamate (N160E) increases the degree of rectification induced by Mg2+ or spermine4+, whereas wild-type rectification is still observed after mutation to other neutral residues (alanine–N160A, glutamine–N160Q). These results are consistent with this residue lining the pore of the channel and contributing to the binding of these cations, as demonstrated for the equivalent site in homomeric ROMK1 (Kir1.1) channels. Since Kir6.2 contains no consensus ATP binding site, whereas SUR1 does, inhibition by ATP has been assumed to depend on interactions with SUR1. However, we found that the [ATP] causing half-maximal inhibition of current (Ki) was affected by mutation of N160. Channels formed from N160D or N160Q mutant subunits had lower apparent sensitivity to ATP (Ki,N160D = 46.1 μM; Ki,N160Q = 62.9 μM) than wild-type, N160E, or N160A channels (Ki = 10.4, 17.7, 6.4 μM, respectively). This might suggest that ATP binding to the channel complex was altered, although examination of channel open probabilities indicates instead that the residue at position 160 alters the ATP-independent open probability, i.e., it controls the free energy of the open state, thereby affecting the “coupling” of ATP binding to channel inhibition. The results can be interpreted in terms of a kinetic scheme whereby the residue at Kir6.2 position 160 controls the rate constants governing transitions to and from the open state, without directly affecting ATP binding or unbinding transitions.},

Up to 30 amino acids could be truncated from the N-terminus, and up to 36 amino acids from the C-terminus without loss of functional channels in co-expression with SUR1. Furthermore, Kir6.2ΔC25 and Kir6.2ΔC36 subunits expressed functional channels in the absence of SUR1. 2 In co-expression with SUR1, N-terminal truncations increased Ki,atp ([ATP] causing half-maximal inhibition of channel activity) by as much as 10-fold, accompanied by an increase in the ATP-insensitive open probability, whereas the C-terminal truncations did not affect the ATP sensitivity of co-expressed channels. 3 A mutation in the near C-terminal region, K185Q, reduced ATP sensitivity of co-expressed channels by approximately 30-fold, and on the Kir6.2ΔN2-30 background, this mutation decreased ATP sensitivity of co-expressed channels by approximately 400-fold. 4 Each of these mutations also reduced the sensitivity to inhibition by ADP, AMP and adenosine tetraphosphate. 5 The results can be quantitatively explained by assuming that the N-terminal deletions stabilize the ATP-independent open state, whereas the Kir6.2K185Q mutation may alter the stability of ATP binding. These two effects are energetically additive, causing the large reduction of ATP sensitivity in the double mutant channels.},

	abstract = {ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels are formed by the coassembly of four Kir6.2 subunits and four sulfonylurea receptor subunits (SUR). The cytoplasmic domains of Kir6.2 mediate channel gating by ATP, which closes the channel, and membrane phosphoinositides, which stabilize the open channel. Little is known, however, about the tertiary or quaternary structures of the domains that are responsible for these interactions. Here, we report that an ion pair between glutamate 229 and arginine 314 in the intracellular COOH terminus of Kir6.2 is critical for maintaining channel activity. Mutation of either residue to alanine induces inactivation, whereas charge reversal at positions 229 and 314 (E229R/R314E) abolishes inactivation and restores the wild-type channel phenotype. The close proximity of these two residues is demonstrated by disulfide bond formation between cysteine residues introduced at the two positions (E229C/R314C); disulfide bond formation abolishes inactivation and stabilizes the current. Using Kir6.2 tandem dimer constructs, we provide evidence that the ion pair likely forms by residues from two adjacent Kir6.2 subunits. We propose that the E229/R314 intersubunit ion pairs may contribute to a structural framework that facilitates the ability of other positively charged residues to interact with membrane phosphoinositides. Glutamate and arginine residues are found at homologous positions in many inward rectifier subunits, including the G-protein–activated inwardly rectifying potassium channel (GIRK), whose cytoplasmic domain structure has recently been solved. In the GIRK structure, the E229- and R314-corresponding residues are oriented in opposite directions in a single subunit such that in the tetramer model, the E229 equivalent residue from one subunit is in close proximity of the R314 equivalent residue from the adjacent subunit. The structure lends support to our findings in Kir6.2, and raises the possibility that a homologous ion pair may be involved in the gating of GIRKs.},

Functional studies demonstrated that PNDM mutations reduce KATP channel sensitivity to ATP inhibition, resulting in gain of channel function. However, the impact of these mutations on channel expression has not been examined. Here, we show that PNDM mutations, including Q52R, V59G, V59M, R201C, R201H, and I296L, not only reduce channel ATP sensitivity but also impair channel expression at the cell surface to varying degrees. By tagging the PNDM Kir6.2 mutant V59G or R201H with an additional mutation, N160D, that confers voltage-dependent polyamine block of KATP channels, we demonstrate that in simulated heterozygous state, all surface channels are either wild-type or heteromeric channels containing both wild-type and mutant Kir6.2 subunits. Comparison of the various PNDM mutations in their effects on channel nucleotide sensitivity and expression, as well as disease phenotype, suggests that both channel-gating defect and expression level may play a role in determining disease severity. Interestingly, sulfonylureas significantly increase surface expression of certain PNDM mutants, suggesting that the efficacy of sulfonylurea therapy may be compromised by the effect of these drugs on channel expression.},

Inhibition by intracellular ATP is a hallmark feature of the channel. ATP sensitivity is conferred by Kir6.2 but enhanced by SUR1. The mechanism by which SUR1 increases channel ATP sensitivity is not understood. In this study, we report molecular interactions between SUR1 and Kir6.2 that markedly alter channel ATP sensitivity. Channels bearing an E203K mutation in SUR1 and a Q52E in Kir6.2 exhibit ATP sensitivity ∼100-fold higher than wild-type channels. Cross-linking of E203C in SUR1 and Q52C in Kir6.2 locks the channel in a closed state and is reversible by reducing agents, demonstrating close proximity of the two residues. Our results reveal that ATP sensitivity in KATP channels is a dynamic parameter dictated by interactions between SUR1 and Kir6.2.},

Sulfonylureas inhibit KATP channel activities by binding to SUR1 and are widely used to treat type II diabetes. We report here that sulfonylureas also function as chemical chaperones to rescue KATP channel trafficking defects caused by two SUR1 mutations, A116P and V187D, identified in patients with congenital hyperinsulinism. Sulfonylureas markedly increased cell surface expression of the A116P and V187D mutants by stabilizing the mutant SUR1 proteins and promoting their maturation. By contrast, diazoxide, a potassium channel opener that also binds SUR1, had no effect on surface expression of either mutant. Importantly, both mutant channels rescued to the cell surface have normal ATP, MgADP, and diazoxide sensitivities, demonstrating that SUR1 harboring either the A116P or the V187D mutation is capable of associating with Kir6.2 to form functional KATP channels. Thus, sulfonylureas may be used to treat congenital hyperinsulinism caused by certain KATP channel trafficking mutations.},

Loss of KATP channel function due to mutations in ABCC8 or KCNJ11, genes that encode the sulfonylurea receptor 1 or the inward rectifier Kir6.2 subunit of the channel, is a major cause of congenital hyperinsulinism. Here, we report identification of a novel KCNJ11 mutation associated with the disease that renders a missense mutation, F55L, in the Kir6.2 protein. Mutant channels reconstituted in COS cells exhibited a wild-type-like surface expression level and normal sensitivity to ATP, MgADP, and diazoxide. However, the intrinsic open probability of the mutant channel was greatly reduced, by ∼10-fold. This low open probability defect could be reversed by application of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphates or oleoyl-CoA to the cytoplasmic face of the channel, indicating that reduced channel response to membrane phospholipids and/or long chain acyl-CoAs underlies the low intrinsic open probability in the mutant. Our findings reveal a novel molecular mechanism for loss of KATP channel function and congenital hyperinsulinism and support the importance of phospholipids and/or long chain acyl-CoAs in setting the physiological activity of β-cell KATP channels. The F55L mutation is located in the slide helix of Kir6.2. Several permanent neonatal diabetes-associated mutations found in the same structure have the opposite effect of increasing intrinsic channel open probability. Our results also highlight the critical role of the Kir6.2 slide helix in determining the intrinsic open probability of KATP channels.},

	abstract = {KATP channels can be formed from Kir6.2 subunits with or without SUR1. The open-state stability of KATP channels can be increased or reduced by mutations throughout the Kir6.2 subunit, and is increased by application of PIP2 to the cytoplasmic membrane. Increase of open-state stability is manifested as an increase in the channel open probability in the absence of ATP (Pozero) and a correlated decrease in sensitivity to inhibition by ATP. Single channel lifetime analyses were performed on wild-type and I154C mutant channels expressed with, and without, SUR1. Channel kinetics include a single, invariant, open duration; an invariant, brief, closed duration; and longer closed events consisting of a “mixture of exponentials,” which are prolonged in ATP and shortened after PIP2 treatment. The steady-state and kinetic data cannot be accounted for by assuming that ATP binds to the channel and causes a gate to close. Rather, we show that they can be explained by models that assume the following regarding the gating behavior: 1) the channel undergoes ATP-insensitive transitions from the open state to a short closed state (Cf) and to a longer-lived closed state (C0); 2) the C0 state is destabilized in the presence of SUR1; and 3) ATP can access this C0 state, stabilizing it and thereby inhibiting macroscopic currents. The effect of PIP2 and mutations that stabilize the open state is then to shift the equilibrium of the “critical transition” from the open state to the ATP-accessible C0 state toward the O state, reducing accessibility of the C0 state, and hence reducing ATP sensitivity.},

The inhibitory effects of nucleotides are mediated via the pore-forming subunit, Kir6.2, whereas the potentiatory effects are conferred by the sulfonylurea receptor subunit, SUR. The stimulatory action of Mg-nucleotides complicates analysis of nucleotide inhibition of Kir6.2/SUR1 channels. We therefore used a truncated isoform of Kir6.2, that expresses ATP-sensitive channels in the absence of SUR1, to explore the mechanism of nucleotide inhibition. We found that Kir6.2 is highly selective for ATP, and that both the adenine moiety and the ?-phosphate contribute to specificity. We also identified several mutations that significantly reduce ATP inhibition. These are located in two distinct regions of Kir6.2: the N-terminus preceding, and the C-terminus immediately following, the transmembrane domains. Some mutations in the C-terminus also markedly increased the channel open probability, which may account for the decrease in apparent ATP sensitivity. Other mutations did not affect the single-channel kinetics, and may reduce ATP inhibition by interfering with ATP binding and/or the link between ATP binding and pore closure. Our results also implicate the proximal C-terminus in KATP channel gating.},

A truncated isoform of Kir6.2 (Kir6.2ΔC26), which expresses independently of SUR1, shows intrinsic ATP sensitivity, suggesting that this subunit is primarily responsible for mediating ATP inhibition. We show here that mutation of C166, which lies at the cytosolic end of the second transmembrane domain, to serine (C166S) increases the open probability of Kir6.2ΔC26 approximately sevenfold by reducing the time the channel spends in a long closed state. Rundown of channel activity is also decreased. Kir6.2ΔC26 containing the C166S mutation shows a markedly reduced ATP sensitivity: the Ki is reduced from 175 μM to 2.8 mM. Substitution of threonine, alanine, methionine, or phenylalanine at position C166 also reduced the channel sensitivity to ATP and simultaneously increased the open probability. Thus, ATP does not act as an open channel blocker. The inhibitory effects of tolbutamide are reduced in channels composed of SUR1 and Kir6.2 carrying the C166S mutation. Our results are consistent with the idea that C166 plays a role in the intrinsic gating of the channel, possibly by influencing a gate located at the intracellular end of the pore. Kinetic analysis suggests that the apparent decrease in ATP sensitivity, and the changes in other properties, observed when C166 is mutated is largely a consequence of the impaired transition from the open to the long closed state.},

This recent discovery has brought together proteins from two very distinct superfamilies in a novel functional complex. The pancreatic KATP channel is probably formed specifically of Kir6.2 and SUR1 isoforms. The relationship between SUR1 and Kir6.2 must be determined to understand how SUR1 and Kir6.2 interact to form this unique channel. We have used mutant Kir6.2 subunits and dimeric (SUR1-Kir6.2) constructs to examine the functional stoichiometry of the KATP channel. The data indicate that the KATP channel pore is lined by four Kir6.2 subunits, and that each Kir6.2 subunit requires one SUR1 subunit to generate a functional channel in an octameric or tetradimeric structure.},

Phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs) profoundly antagonized ATP inhibition of KATP channels when applied to inside-out membrane patches. It is proposed that membrane-incorporated PIPs can bind to positive charges in the cytoplasmic region of the channel's Kir6.2 subunit, stabilizing the open state of the channel and antagonizing the inhibitory effect of ATP. The tremendous effect of PIPs on ATP sensitivity suggests that in vivo alterations of membrane PIP levels will have substantial effects on KATP channel activity and hence on the gain of metabolism-excitation coupling.},

A mutation in the second nucleotide-binding fold (NBF2) of the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) of an individual diagnosed with persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy generated KATP channels that could be opened by diazoxide but not in response to metabolic inhibition. The hamster SUR, containing the analogous mutation, had normal ATP sensitivity, but unlike wild-type channels, inhibition by ATP was not antagonized by adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Additional mutations in NBF2 resulted in the same phenotype, whereas an equivalent mutation in NBF1 showed normal sensitivity to MgADP. Thus, by binding to SUR NBF2 and antagonizing ATP inhibition of KATP channels, intracellular MgADP may regulate insulin secretion.},

Expression cloning of the first inward rectifier K channel (Kir) genes provided the necessary breakthrough that has led to isolation of a family of related clones encoding channels with the essential functional properties of classical inward rectifiers, ATP-sensitive K channels, and muscarinic receptor-activated K channels. High-level expression of cloned channels led to the discovery that classical inward so-called anomalous rectification is caused by voltage-dependent block of the channel by polyamines and Mg2+ ions, and it is now clear that a similar mechanism results in inward rectification of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA)-kainate receptor channels. Knowledge of the primary structures of Kir channels and the ability to mutate them also has led to the determination of many of the structural requirements of inward rectification.},

	abstract = {ATP-sensitive K (KATP) channels are blocked by ATP and activated by PIP2. Both negatively-charged ligands are presumed to bind to positively-charged residues on the N-and C-termini of the channel's cytoplasmic domain. Evidence summarized here suggests that the channel's interaction with ATP and PIP2 is regulated by separate groups of residues, involving both direct charge-charge interactions and allosteric effects. ATP interaction is regulated by R50 in the N-terminus and by K185, R192 and R201 in the C-terminus. R192 and R201 mutations decrease channel sensitivity to ATP, ADP and AMP to a similar extent, implying that they regulate interaction with either the α phosphate group, common to all three adenine nucleotides, or the adenosine moiety. K185 mutations, and to a lesser extent R50 mutations, decrease ATP and ADP sensitivity without markedly affecting AMP sensitivity, implying that they regulate interaction with the β phosphate of ATP and ADP. In addition, when open probability decreases due to rundown, ATP sensitivity increases in R50, K185 and R192, but not in R201 mutants. Combining these observations with recent structural data, we hypothesize the following scenario: 1) the ATP binding site is located at the outside of the channel's cytoplasmic domain away from the pore. 2) When the channel is open, R50 and K185 interact directly with the β phosphate of ATP, whereas R192, which appears to be removed from the ATP binding site, modulates the initial interaction with ATP allosterically. 3) When the channel closes, R201 is in position to interact with the α phosphate of ATP to stabilize the closed state. 4) PIP2 also interacts with the channel's cytoplasmic domain, but at distinct positively-charged residues located above the ATP binding site and near to the plasma membrane. These residues include R54 in the N-terminus and R176, R177 and R206 in the C-terminus. Thus, the binding domains of ATP and PIP2 in the N- and C-termini do not appear to overlap.},

	abstract = {Most theories and hypotheses in psychology are verbal in nature, yet their evaluation overwhelmingly relies on inferential statistical procedures. The validity of the move from qualitative to quantitative analysis depends on the verbal and statistical expressions of a hypothesis being closely aligned—that is, that the two must refer to roughly the same set of hypothetical observations. Here I argue that many applications of statistical inference in psychology fail to meet this basic condition. Focusing on the most widely used class of model in psychology—the linear mixed model—I explore the consequences of failing to statistically operationalize verbal hypotheses in a way that respects researchers' actual generalization intentions. I demonstrate that whereas the "random effect" formalism is used pervasively in psychology to model inter-subject variability, few researchers accord the same treatment to other variables they clearly intend to generalize over (e.g., stimuli, tasks, or research sites). The under-specification of random effects imposes far stronger constraints on the generalizability of results than most researchers appreciate. Ignoring these constraints can dramatically inflate false positive rates, and often leads researchers to draw sweeping verbal generalizations that lack a meaningful connection to the statistical quantities they are putatively based on. I argue that failure to take the alignment between verbal and statistical expressions seriously lies at the heart of many of psychology's ongoing problems (e.g., the replication crisis), and conclude with a discussion of several potential avenues for improvement.},

However, it can prove problematic to ensure the homogeneity of the expressed proteins, when homogeneity is compromised by “leak expression”. Here, we show that leak expression may be mediated by reinitiation and can result in unwanted proteins when stop codons for UAA insertion are mutated into the N-terminus of proteins. We demonstrate that up to 25\% of leak expression occurs through reinitiation in the Shaker-Kv channel when stop codons are located within the first 70 amino acids. Several non-canonical start codons were identified as translation reinitaition sites and by removing the start codons, we were able to decrease leak expression to less than 1\%. Our study emphasizes the need to carefully inspect for leak expression when inserting UAAs and demonstrates how leak expression can be eliminated.},

	abstract = {In-frame stop codons mark the termination of translation. However, post-termination ribosomes can reinitiate translation at downstream AUG codons. In mammals, reinitiation is most efficient when the termination codon is positioned close to the 5′-proximal initiation site and around 78 bases upstream of the reinitiation site. The phenomenon was studied mainly in the context of open reading frames (ORFs) found within the 5′-untranslated region, or polycicstronic viral mRNA. We hypothesized that reinitiation of translation following nonsense mutations within the main ORF of p53 can promote the expression of N-truncated p53 isoforms such as Δ40, Δ133 and Δ160p53. Here, we report that expression of all known N-truncated p53 isoforms by reinitiation is mechanistically feasible, including expression of the previously unidentified variant Δ66p53. Moreover, we found that significant reinitiation of translation can be promoted by nonsense mutations located even 126 codons downstream of the 5′-proximal initiation site, and observed when the reinitiation site is positioned between 6 and 243 bases downstream of the nonsense mutation. We also demonstrate that reinitiation can stabilise p53 mRNA transcripts with a premature termination codon, by allowing such transcripts to evade the nonsense mediated decay pathway. Our data suggest that the expression of N-truncated proteins from alleles carrying a premature termination codon is more prevalent than previously thought.},

	abstract = {TNP-modified nucleotides have been used extensively to study protein–nucleotide interactions. In the case of ABC-ATPases, application of these powerful tools has been greatly restricted due to the significantly higher affinity of the TNP-nucleotide for the corresponding ABC-ATPase in comparison to the non-modified nucleotides. To understand the molecular changes occurring upon binding of the TNP-nucleotide to an ABC-ATPase, we have determined the crystal structure of the TNP–ADP/HlyB–NBD complex at 1.6Å resolution. Despite the higher affinity of TNP–ADP, no direct fluorophore–protein interactions were observed. Unexpectedly, only water-mediated interactions were detected between the TNP moiety and Tyr477, that is engaged in π–π stacking with the adenine ring, as well as with two serine residues (Ser504 and Ser509) of the Walker A motif. Interestingly, the side chains of these two serine residues adopt novel conformations that are not observed in the corresponding ADP structure. However, in the crystal structure of the S504A mutant, which binds TNP–ADP with similar affinity to the wild type enzyme, a novel TNP–water interaction compensates for the missing serine side chain. Since this water molecule is not present in the wild type enzyme, these results suggest that only water-mediated interactions provide a structural explanation for the increased affinity of TNP-nucleotides towards ABC-ATPases. However, our results also imply that in silico approaches such as docking or modeling cannot directly be applied to generate ‘affinity-adopted’ ADP- or ATP-analogs for ABC-ATPases.},

The fidelity of protein synthesis at reassigned UAG codons and the purity of the NSAA containing proteins produced require careful examination. Proteomics would be an ideal tool for these tasks, but conventional proteomic analyses cannot readily identify the extended proteins and accurately discover multiple amino acid (AA) insertions at a single UAG. To address these challenges, we created a new proteomic workflow that enabled the detection of UAG readthrough in native proteins in E. coli strains in which UAG was reassigned to encode phosphoserine. The method also enabled quantitation of NSAA and natural AA incorporation at UAG in a recombinant reporter protein. As a proof-of-principle, we measured the fidelity and purity of the phosphoserine orthogonal translation system (OTS) and used this information to improve its performance. Our results show a surprising diversity of natural AAs at reassigned stop codons. Our method can be used to improve OTSs and to quantify amino acid purity at reassigned codons in organisms with expanded genetic codes.},

The genetic encoding of unnatural amino acids will remove this restriction and enable new chemical and physical properties to be precisely introduced into proteins. Here we present new strategies for generating orthogonal tRNA-synthetase pairs, which made possible the genetic encoding of diverse unnatural amino acids in different mammalian cells and primary neurons. Using this new methodology, we incorporated unnatural amino acids with extended side chains into the K+ channel Kv1.4, and found that the bulkiness of residues in the inactivation peptide is essential for fast channel inactivation, a finding that had not been possible using conventional mutagenesis. This technique will stimulate and facilitate new molecular studies using tailored unnatural amino acids for cell biology and neurobiology.},

We examined the influence of these downstream nucleotides on translation termination success or failure in mammalian cells at the three stop codons. The expected hierarchy in the intrinsic fidelity of the stop codons (UAA\&gt;UAG\&gt;\&gt;UGA) was observed, with highly influential effects on termination readthrough mediated by nucleotides at position +4 and position +8. A more complex influence was observed from the nucleotides at positions +5 and +6. The weakest termination contexts were most affected by increases or decreases in the concentration of the decoding release factor (eRF1), indicating that eRF1 binding to these signals was rate-limiting. When termination efficiency was significantly reduced by cognate suppressor tRNAs, the observed influence of downstream nucleotides was maintained. There was a positive correlation between experimentally measured signal strength and frequency of the signal in eukaryotic genomes, particularly in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster. We propose that termination efficiency is not only influenced by interrogation of the stop signal directly by the release factor, but also by downstream ribosomal interactions with the mRNA nucleotides in the entry channel.},

However, little effort has been made to investigate whether stop codon usage exhibits biases, such as widely seen for synonymous codon usage. Here we systematically investigate stop codon usage bias in various eukaryotes as well as its relationships with its context, GC3 content, gene expression level, and secondary structure. The results show that there is a strong bias for stop codon usage in different eukaryotes, i.e., UAA is overrepresented in the lower eukaryotes, UGA is overrepresented in the higher eukaryotes, and UAG is least used in all eukaryotes. Different conserved patterns for each stop codon in different eukaryotic classes are found based on information content and logo analysis. GC3 contents increase with increasing complexity of organisms. Secondary structure prediction revealed that UAA is generally associated with loop structures, whereas UGA is more uniformly present in loop and stem structures, i.e., UGA is less biased toward having a particular structure. The stop codon usage bias, however, shows no significant relationship with GC3 content and gene expression level in individual eukaryotes. The results indicate that genomic complexity and GC3 content might contribute to stop codon usage bias in different eukaryotes. Our results indicate that stop codons, like synonymous codons, exhibit biases in usage. Additional work will be needed to understand the causes of these biases and their relationship to the mechanism of protein termination.},

the potential of genetic code expansion approaches. Addressing this
challenge will allow the synthesis of modified recombinant proteins
and augment emerging strategies that introduce new chemical functionalities

and temporal precision in cells. The efficiency of unnatural amino
acid incorporation in response to the amber stop codon (UAG) in mammalian
cells is commonly considered to be low. Here we demonstrate that tRNA
levels can be limiting for unnatural amino acid incorporation efficiency,
and we develop an optimized pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNACUA expression system, with optimized tRNA expression for mammalian
cells. In addition, we engineer eRF1, that normally terminates translation
on all three stop codons, to provide a substantial increase in unnatural
amino acid incorporation in response to the UAG codon without increasing
readthrough of other stop codons. By combining the optimized pyrrolysyl-tRNA
synthetase/tRNACUA expression system and an engineered
eRF1, we increase the yield of protein bearing unnatural amino acids
at a single site 17- to 20-fold. Using the optimized system, we produce
proteins containing unnatural amino acids with comparable yields to
a protein produced from a gene that does not contain a UAG stop codon.
Moreover, the optimized system increases the yield of protein, incorporating
an unnatural amino acid at three sites, from unmeasurably low levels
up to 43\% of a no amber stop control. Our approach may enable the
efficient production of site-specifically modified therapeutic proteins,
and the quantitative replacement of targeted cellular proteins with

Methods Medical records of patients with wAMD, who started ranibizumab treatment between 1 January 2009 and 31 August 2009, were evaluated. Data were collected until the end of treatment and/or monitoring or until 31 August 2011.
Results 2227 patients who received ≥1 anti-VEGF injection with a baseline visual acuity assessment and ≥1 postbaseline visual acuity assessment for the treated eye were evaluated. Visual acuity improved until about day 120; thereafter, visual acuity gains were not maintained. Mean change in visual acuity score from baseline to years 1 and 2 was +2.4 and +0.6 letters, respectively. Patients received a mean of 5.0 and 2.2 injections in the first and second year, respectively. There were substantial differences in visual outcomes and injection frequency between countries. More frequent visits and injections were associated with greater improvements in visual acuity.
Conclusions In clinical practice, fewer injections are administered than in clinical trials. Anti-VEGF treatment resulted in an initial improvement in visual acuity; however, this was not maintained over time.

Multilevel models have become a standard data analysis approach in intervention research. Although the vast majority of intervention studies involve multiple outcome measures, few studies use multivariate analysis methods. The authors discuss multivariate extensions to the multilevel model that can be used by psychotherapy researchers.

Method and Results
Using simulated longitudinal treatment data, the authors show how multivariate models extend common univariate growth models and how the multivariate model can be used to examine multivariate hypotheses involving fixed effects (e.g., does the size of the treatment effect differ across outcomes?) and random effects (e.g., is change in one outcome related to change in the other?). An  provides annotated computer code and simulated example data for implementing a multivariate model.

Multivariate multilevel models are flexible, powerful models that can enhance clinical research.},

	abstract = {Mutations in the pore-forming subunit of the ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel Kir6.2 cause neonatal diabetes. Understanding the molecular mechanism of action of these mutations has provided valuable insight into the relationship between the structure and function of the KATP channel. When Kir6.2 containing a mutation (F333I) in the putative ATP-binding site is coexpressed with the cardiac type of regulatory KATP channel subunit, SUR2A, the channel sensitivity to ATP inhibition is reduced and the intrinsic open probability (Po) is increased. However, the extent of macroscopic current activation by MgADP was unaffected. Here we examine rundown and MgADP activation of wild-type and Kir6.2-F333I/SUR2A channels using single-channel recording, noise analysis and spectral analysis. We also compare the effect of mutating the adjacent residue, G334, on rundown and MgADP activation. All three approaches indicated that rundown of Kir6.2-F333I/SUR2A channels is due to a reduction in the number of active channels in the patch and that MgADP reactivation involves recruitment of inactive channels. In contrast, rundown and MgADP reactivation of wild-type and Kir6.2-G334D/SUR2A channels, and of Kir6.2-F333I/SUR1 channels, involve a gradual change in Po. Our results suggest that F333 in Kir6.2 interacts functionally with SUR2A to modulate channel rundown and MgADP activation. This interaction is fairly specific as it is not disturbed when the adjacent residue (G334) is mutated. It is also not a consequence of the enhanced Po of Kir6.2-F333I/SUR2A channels, as it is not found for other mutant channels with high Po (Kir6.2-I296L/SUR2A).},

Similar swelling-activated anion channels have been described in numerous cell types. The unitary conductance and gating kinetics of VSOAC have been uncertain, however. Stationary noise analysis and single-channel measurements have produced estimates for the unitary conductance of swelling-activated, outwardly rectified anion channels that vary by \&gt; 15-fold. We used a combination of stationary and nonstationary noise analyses and single-channel measurements to estimate the unitary properties of VSOAC. Current noise was analyzed initially by assuming that graded changes in macroscopic current were due to graded changes in channel open probability. Stationary noise analysis predicts that the unitary conductance of VSOAC is approximately 1 pS at 0 mV. In sharp contrast, nonstationary noise analysis demonstrates that VSOAC is a 40-50 pS channel at +120 mV (approximately 15 pS at 0 mV). Measurement of single-channel events in whole-cell currents and outside-out membrane patches confirmed the nonstationary noise analysis results. The discrepancy between stationary and nonstationary noise analyses and single-channel measurements indicates that swelling-induced current activation is not mediated by a graded increase in channel open probability as assumed initially. Instead, activation of VSOAC appears to involve an abrupt switching of single channels from an OFF state, where channel open probability is zero, to an ON state, where open probability is near unity.},

In this study we have exploited the blockade by Ca2+ to examine the size of the CRAC channel pore, its unitary conductance for monovalent cations, and channel gating properties. The permeation of a series of methylammonium compounds under divalent cation-free conditions indicates a minimum pore diameter of 3.9 Å. Extracellular Ca2+ blocks monovalent flux in a manner consistent with a single intrapore site having an effective Ki of 20 μM at −110 mV. Block increases with hyperpolarization, but declines below −100 mV, most likely due to permeation of Ca2+. Analysis of monovalent current noise induced by increasing levels of block by extracellular Ca2+ indicates an open probability (Po) of ∼0.8. By extrapolating the variance/mean current ratio to the condition of full blockade (Po = 0), we estimate a unitary conductance of ∼0.7 pS for Na+, or three to fourfold higher than previous estimates. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ causes the monovalent current to decline over tens of seconds, a process termed depotentiation. The declining current appears to result from a reduction in the number of active channels without a change in their high open probability. Similarly, low concentrations of 2-APB that enhance ICRAC increase the number of active channels while open probability remains constant. We conclude that the slow regulation of whole-cell CRAC current by store depletion, extracellular Ca2+, and 2-APB involves the stepwise recruitment of silent channels to a high open-probability gating mode.},

	abstract = {1. Single myelinated nerve fibres 12-17 μm in diameter from Rana temporaria and Rana pipiens were voltage clamped at 2-5 °C. Potassium currents were blocked by internal Cs+ and external tetraethylammonium ion. Series resistance compensation was employed. 2. Sets of 80-512 identical, 20 ms depolarizations were applied, with the pulses repeated at intervals of 300-600 ms. The resulting membrane current records, filtered at 5 kHz, showed record-to-record variations of the current on the order of 1\%. From each set of records the time course of the mean current and the time course of the variance were calculated. 3. The variance was assumed to arise primarily from two independent sources of current fluctuations: the stochastic gating of sodium channels and the thermal noise background in the voltage clamp. Measurement of the passive properties of the nerve preparation allowed the thermal noise variance to be estimated, and these estimates accounted for the variance observed in the presence of tetrodotoxin and at the reversal potential. 4. After the variance σ2 was corrected for the contribution from the background, its relationship to the mean current I could be fitted by the function σ2 = iI—I2/N expected for N independent channels having one non-zero conductance level. The single channel currents i corresponded to a single-channel chord conductance γ = 6·4 ± 0·9 pS (S.D.; n = 14). No significant difference in γ was observed between the two species of frogs. The size of the total population of channels ranged from 20,000 to 46,000. 5. The voltage dependence of i corresponded closely to the form of the instantaneous current—voltage relationship of the sodium conductance, except at the smallest depolarizations. The small values of i at small depolarizations may have resulted from the filtering of high-frequency components of the fluctuations. 6. It is concluded that sodium channels have only two primary levels of conductance, corresponding to ‘open’ and ‘closed’ states of the channel. 7. The fraction pmax of channels open at the time of the peak conductance was found to be 0·59 ± 0·08 (S.D.; n = 5) and 0·9 ± 0·1 (S.D.; n = 3) for depolarizations to -5 and +125 mV, respectively. (50 ms hyperpolarizations to -105 mV preceded the depolarizations in each case.) These values are similar to those predicted by Hodgkin-Huxley kinetics. 8. Fluctuations in the firing threshold of neurones are expected from the stochastic gating of sodium channels. A prediction of the size of these fluctuations based on the measured properties of the channels gives a value of about 1\% for the relative spread, which agrees with experimental values in the literature.},

From our study of these fluctuations, we have concluded that the EIM-doped bilayer contains ion-conducting channels capable of undergoing transitions between two states of different conductance. The difference in current between the "open" and "closed" states is directly proportional to the applied membrane potential, and corresponds to a conductance of about 3 x 10-10 ohm-1. The fraction of the total number of channels that is open varies from unity to zero as a function of potential. The voltage-dependent opening and closing of channels explains the negative resistance observed for bimolecular lipid membranes treated with greater amounts of EIM.},

	abstract = {Ion channels open and close in a stochastic fashion, following the laws of probability. However, distinct from tossing a coin or a die, the probability of finding the channel closed or open is not a fixed number but can be modified (i.e., we can cheat) by some external stimulus, such as the voltage. Single-channel records can be obtained using the appropriate electrophysiological technique (e.g., patch clamp), and from these records the open probability and the channel conductance can be calculated. Gathering these parameters from a membrane containing many channels is not straightforward, as the macroscopic current I = iNPo, where i is the single-channel current, N the number of channels, and Po the probability of finding the channel open, cannot be split into its individual components. In this tutorial, using the probabilistic nature of ion channels, we discuss in detail how i, N, and Po max (the maximum open probability) can be obtained using fluctuation (nonstationary noise) analysis (Sigworth FJ. G Gen Physiol 307: 97–129, 1980). We also analyze the sources of possible artifacts in the determination of i and N, such as channel rundown, inadequate filtering, and limited resolution of digital data acquisition by use of a simulation computer program (available at  www.cecs.cl).},

The procedure presented allows a rapid analysis of noise records obtained under nonideal experimental conditions based on objective selection criteria. Although single-channel analysis surpasses noise analysis in many instances, there are still regimes, where it cannot be successfully applied for various reasons. In this regard, nonstationary noise analysis retain its value for electrophysiological research in particular, as ever fainter electrical signals are being investigated in biological membranes. To demonstrate the methods, the temperature and pressure dependence of the sodium channel conductance are measured, and in both respects, the sodium channel shows features similar to other ion channels. Both findings are in accord with the physical picture of a rather free ion diffusion through the channel pore which, unlike the channel gating mechanism, does not involve protein rearrangements associated with measurable activation volumes.},

Swelling activated anion channels have recently been recognized to play an important role in not only volume regulatory electrolyte movement, but also in organic osmolyte transport. A swelling-activated, outwardly rectifying anion channel termed VSOAC (volume-sensitive organic osmolyte/anion channel) is a major pathway for swelling-induced loss of organic osmolytes and organic anions from mammalian cells. VSOAC has been described in numerous cell types. Until recently, however, the unitary conductance and gating kinetics of VSOAC were uncertain. Stationary noise analysis and single channel measurements have produced estimates for the unitary conductance of swelling-activated, outwardly rectifying anion channels that vary by {\textgreater} 15-fold. This review describes our current understanding of the single channel properties of VSOAC.},

To examine potential errors associated with fluctuation analysis, we simulated ensemble currents and estimated single channel properties. The number (N) and amplitude (i) of the underlying single channels were estimated using nonstationary fluctuation analysis, while mean open time was estimated using covariance and spectral analysis. Both excessive filtering and the analysis of segments of current that were too brief led to underestimates of i and overestimates of N. Setting the low-pass cut-off frequency of the filter to greater than five times the inverse of the effective mean channel open time (burst duration) and analyzing segments of current that were at least 80 times the effective mean channel open time reduced the errors to {\textless} 2\%. With excessive filtering, Butterworth filtering gave up to 10\% less error in estimating i and N than Bessel filtering. Estimates of mean open time obtained from the time constant of decay of the covariance, tau obs, at low open probabilities (Po) were much less sensitive to filtering than estimates of i and N. Extrapolating plots of tau obs versus mean current to the ordinate provided a method to estimate mean open time from data obtained at higher Po, where tau obs no longer represents mean open time. Bessel filtering gave the least error when estimating tau obs from the decay of the covariance function, and Butterworth filtering gave the least error when estimating tau obs from spectral density functions.},

Binding of ATP to Kir6.2 leads to inhibition of channel activity. Because there are four subunits and thus four ATP-binding sites, four binding events are possible. ATP binds to both the open and closed states of the channel and produces a decrease in the mean open time, a reduction in the mean burst duration, and an increase in the frequency and duration of the interburst closed states. Here, we investigate the mechanism of interaction of ATP with the open state of the channel by analyzing the single-channel kinetics of concatenated Kir6.2 tetramers containing from zero to four mutated Kir6.2 subunits that possess an impaired ATP-binding site. We show that the ATP-dependent decrease in the mean burst duration is well described by a Monod-Wyman-Changeux model in which channel closing is produced by all four subunits acting in a single concerted step. The data are inconsistent with a Hodgkin-Huxley model (four independent steps) or a dimer model (two independent dimers). When the channel is open, ATP binds to a single ATP-binding site with a dissociation constant of 300 μM.},

Upon excision of inside-out patches into a Ca2+- and MgATP-free solution, the activity of Kir6.2-GFP+SUR1 channels spontaneously ran down, first quickly within a minute, and then more slowly over tens of minutes. In contrast, under the same conditions, the activity of Kir6.2-GFP alone exhibited only slow rundown. Thus, fast rundown is specific to Kir6.2-GFP+SUR1 and involves SUR1, while slow rundown is a property of both Kir6.2-GFP and Kir6.2-GFP+SUR1 channels and is due, at least in part, to Kir6.2 alone. Kir6.2-GFP+SUR1 fast phase of rundown was of variable amplitude and led to increased ATP sensitivity. Excising patches into a solution containing MgADP prevented this phenomenon, suggesting that fast rundown involves loss of MgADP-dependent stimulation conferred by SUR1. With both Kir6.2-GFP and Kir6.2-GFP+SUR1, the slow phase of rundown led to further increase in ATP sensitivity. Ca2+ accelerated this process, suggesting a role for PIP2 hydrolysis mediated by a Ca2+-dependent phospholipase C. PIP2 could reactivate channel activity after a brief exposure to Ca2+, but not after prolonged exposure. However, in both cases, PIP2 reversed the increase in ATP sensitivity, indicating that PIP2 lowers the ATP sensitivity by increasing Po as well as by decreasing the channel affinity for ATP. With Kir6.2-GFP+SUR1, slow rundown also caused loss of MgADP stimulation and sulfonylurea inhibition, suggesting functional uncoupling of SUR1 from Kir6.2-GFP. Ca2+ facilitated the loss of sensitivity to MgADP, and thus uncoupling of the two subunits. The nonselective protein kinase inhibitor H-7 and the selective PKC inhibitor peptide 19-36 evoked, within 5–15 min, increased ATP sensitivity and loss of reactivation by PIP2 and MgADP. Phosphorylation of Kir6.2 may thus be required for the channel to remain PIP2 responsive, while phosphorylation of Kir6.2 and/or SUR1 is required for functional coupling. In summary, short-term regulation of Kir6.2+SUR1 channels involves MgADP, while long-term regulation requires PIP2 and phosphorylation.},

In the present study, we examined how PIP2 interaction regulates channel availability and channel openings to various subconductance levels (sublevels) as well as the fully open state in the strong inward rectifier Kir2.1 channel. Various Kir2.1 channel constructs were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and single channel or macroscopic currents were recorded from inside-out patches. The wild-type (WT) channel rarely visited the subconductance levels under control conditions. However, upon reducing Kir2.1 channel interaction with PIP2 by a variety of interventions, including PIP2 antibodies, screening PIP2 with neomycin, or mutating PIP2 binding sites (e.g. K188Q), visitation to the sublevels was markedly increased before channels were converted to an unavailable mode in which they did not open. No channel activity was detected in channels with the double mutation K188A/R189A, a mutant which exhibits extremely weak interaction with PIP2. By linking subunits together in tandem dimers or tetramers containing mixtures of WT and K188A/R189A subunits, we demonstrate that one functional PIP2-interacting WT subunit is sufficient to convert channels from the unavailable to the available mode with a high open probability dominated by the fully open state, with similar kinetics as tetrameric WT channels. Occasional openings to sublevels become progressively less frequent as the number of WT subunits increases. Quantitative analysis reveals that the interaction of PIP2 with WT subunits exerts strong positive cooperativity in both converting the channels from the unavailable to the available mode, and in promoting the fully open state over sublevels. We conclude that the interaction of PIP2 with only one Kir2.1 subunit is sufficient for the channel to become available and to open to its full conductance state. Interaction with additional subunits exerts positive cooperativity at multiple levels to further enhance channel availability and promote the fully open state.},

These channels were inhibited by ATP (IC50= 150 μM), but were not responsive to stimulation by ADP or inhibition by sulphonylureas. Typically, 15 ± 7 active channels were found in an excised patch. 3 The distribution of Kir6.2-C-GFP protein was investigated by imaging of GFP fluorescence. There was a lamellar pattern of fluorescence labelling inside the cytoplasm (presumably associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus) and intense punctate labelling near the cell membrane, but little fluorescence was associated with the plasma membrane. 4 In contrast, cells co-transfected with Kir6.2-C-GFP and SUR1 exhibited intense uniform plasma membrane labelling, and the lamellar and punctate labelling seen without SUR1 was no longer prominent. 5 In cells co-transfected with Kir6.2-C-GFP and SUR1, strong membrane labelling was associated with very high channel activity, with 484 ± 311 active channels per excised patch. These K+ channels were sensitive to inhibition by ATP (IC50= 17 μM), stimulated by ADP and inhibited by sulphonylureas. 6 We conclude that co-expression of SUR1 and Kir6.2 generates channels with the properties of native KATP channels. In addition, SUR1 promotes uniform insertion of Kir6.2-C-GFP into the plasma membrane and a 35-fold increase in channel activity, suggesting that SUR1 facilitates protein trafficking of Kir6.2 into the plasma membrane.},

	abstract = {ATP-sensitive potassium (“KATP”) channels are rapidly inhibited by intracellular ATP. This inhibition plays a crucial role in the coupling of electrical activity to energy metabolism in a variety of cells. The KATP channel is formed from four each of a sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) regulatory subunit and an inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir6.2) pore-forming subunit. We used systematic chimeric and point mutagenesis, combined with patch-clamp recording, to investigate the molecular basis of ATP-dependent inhibition gating of mouse pancreatic β cell KATP channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. We identified distinct functional domains of the presumed cytoplasmic C-terminal segment of the Kir6.2 subunit that play an important role in this inhibition. Our results suggest that one domain is associated with inhibitory ATP binding and another with gate closure.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}ATP-sensitive potassium (K$_{\textrm{ATP}}$) channels are expressed in many excitable, as well as epithelial, cells and couple metabolic changes to modulation of cell activity. ATP regulation of K$_{\textrm{ATP}}$ channel activity may involve direct binding of this nucleotide to the pore-forming inward rectifier (Kir) subunit despite the lack of known nucleotide-binding motifs. To examine this possibility, we assessed the binding of the fluorescent ATP analogue, 2′,3′-\textit{O}-(2,4,6-trinitrophenylcyclo-hexadienylidene)adenosine 5′-triphosphate (TNP-ATP) to maltose-binding fusion proteins of the NH$_{\textrm{2}}$- and COOH-terminal cytosolic regions of the three known K$_{\textrm{ATP}}$ channels (Kir1.1, Kir6.1, and Kir6.2) as well as to the COOH-terminal region of an ATP-insensitive inward rectifier K$^{\textrm{+}}$ channel (Kir2.1). We show direct binding of TNP-ATP to the COOH termini of all three known K$_{\textrm{ATP}}$ channels but not to the COOH terminus of the ATP-insensitive channel, Kir2.1. TNP-ATP binding was specific for the COOH termini of K$_{\textrm{ATP}}$ channels because this nucleotide did not bind to the NH$_{\textrm{2}}$ termini of Kir1.1 or Kir6.1. The affinities for TNP-ATP binding to K$_{\textrm{ATP}}$ COOH termini of Kir1.1, Kir6.1, and Kir6.2 were similar. Binding was abolished by denaturing with 4 m urea or SDS and enhanced by reduction in pH. TNP-ATP to protein stoichiometries were similar for all K$_{\textrm{ATP}}$ COOH-terminal proteins with 1 mol of TNP-ATP binding/mole of protein. Competition of TNP-ATP binding to the Kir1.1 COOH terminus by MgATP was complex with both Mg$^{\textrm{2+}}$ and MgATP effects. Glutaraldehyde cross-linking demonstrated the multimerization potential of these COOH termini, suggesting that these cytosolic segments may directly interact in intact tetrameric channels. Thus, the COOH termini of K$_{\textrm{ATP}}$tetrameric channels contain the nucleotide-binding pockets of these metabolically regulated channels with four potential nucleotide-binding sites/channel tetramer.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

To determine residues important for PIP2 regulation, we have systematically mutated each positive charge in the COOH terminus of Kir6.2 to alanine. The effects of these mutations on channel function were examined using 86Rb efflux assays on intact cells and inside-out patch-clamp methods. Both methods identify essentially the same basic residues in two narrow regions (176–222 and 301–314) in the COOH terminus that are important for the maintenance of channel function and interaction with PIP2. Only one residue (R201A) simultaneously affected ATP and PIP2 sensitivity, which is consistent with the notion that these ligands, while functionally competitive, are unlikely to bind to identical sites. Strikingly, none of 13 basic residues in the terminal portion (residues 315–390) of the COOH terminus affected channel function when neutralized. The data help to define the structural requirements for PIP2 sensitivity of KATP channels. Moreover, the regions and residues defined in this study parallel those uncovered in recent studies of PIP2 sensitivity in other inward rectifier channels, indicating a common structural basis for PIP2 regulation.},

	abstract = {Inwardly rectifying, ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP) couple metabolism to either cell excitability (Kir6.x) or potassium secretion (Kir1.1). Phosphatidylinositol phospholipids, like PI(4,5)P2, antagonize nucleotide inhibition of KATP channels enhancing the coupling of metabolic events to cell electrical or transport activity. The mechanism by which phospholipids relieve ATP block is unclear. We have shown that maltose-binding fusion proteins (MBP) containing the COOH termini of KATP channels (Kir1.1, Kir6.1, and Kir6.2) form functional tetramers that directly bind at least two ATP molecules with negative cooperativity. Here we show that purified phosphatidylinositol phospholipids compete for 2,4,6,-trinitrophenyl (TNP)-ATP binding to the COOH termini of KATP channels with EC50 values for PIP2 between 6–8 μM. The phospholipid potency profile was PIP3 {\textgreater} PIP2 = PIP {\textgreater} PI, suggesting that net phospholipid charge was important. A role for head group charge was supported by polycations (neomycin, spermine, and polylysine) reversing the effect of PIP2 on TNP-ATP binding to the Kir1.1 channel COOH terminal fusion protein. In contrast, the water-soluble charged hydrolytic product of PIP2, inositol(1,4,5)P3 (IP3), had no effect on TNP-ATP binding, suggesting that the acyl chain of PIP2 was also necessary for its effect on TNP-ATP binding. Indeed, neutral and charged lipids had weak, but significant, effects on TNP-ATP binding. Whereas μM concentrations of PIP2 could compete with TNP-ATP, we found that mM concentrations of MgATP were required to compete with PIP2 for binding to these KATP channel COOH termini. Thus the COOH termini of KATP channels form a nucleotide- and phospholipid-modulated channel gate on which ATP and phospholipids compete for binding.},

These channels are heteromultimers composed with a 4:4 stoichiometry of an inwardly rectifying K+ channel subunit (Kir6.2) plus a regulatory sulfonylurea receptor. To elucidate stoichiometry of ATP(4-) action, we analyzed ATP(4-) sensitivity of channels coassembled from wild-type Kir6.2 and a loss of ATP(4-) sensitivity mutant (G334D). Concentration-inhibition curves for cDNA ratios of 1:1 or 1:10 resembled those for channel block resulting from interaction with 1 of 4 sites, whereas models for inhibition requiring occupation of 2, 3, or 4 sites were incongruous. Random assembly of wild-type Kir6.2 with the G334D mutant was confirmed by controls, which assessed the effect of an additional mutation that induced strong rectification (N160D). We conclude 4 identical noncooperative ATP(4-) sites to be grouped within 1 KATP channel complex, with occupation of 1 site being sufficient to induce channel closure. This architecture might facilitate coupling of [ATP(4-)] to insulin secretion and may protect against diabetic dysregulation resulting from heterozygous mutations in Kir6.2.},

We tested the functional effects of two Kir6.2 mutations (Y330C, F333I) that cause permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus, by heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes. Both mutations reduced ATP inhibition and increased whole-cell currents, which in pancreatic ?-cells is expected to reduce insulin secretion and precipitate diabetes. The Y330C mutation reduced ATP inhibition both directly, by impairing ATP binding (and/or transduction), and indirectly, by stabilizing the intrinsic open state of the channel. The F333I mutation altered ATP binding/transduction directly. Both mutations also altered Kir6.2/SUR1 interactions, enhancing the stimulatory effect of MgATP (which is mediated via SUR1). This effect was particularly dramatic for the Kir6.2-F333I mutation, and was abolished by SUR1 mutations that prevent MgATP binding/hydrolysis. Further analysis of F333I heterozygous channels indicated that at least three SUR1 must bind/hydrolyse MgATP to open the mutant KATP channel.},

	abstract = {Based initially on their prominence in the squid giant axon, their useful pharmacology, and subsequently on being the first cloned K channels, voltage-gated K (Kv) channels have received the lion's share of attention to their biophysical properties. Kv and Ca-activated K channel kinetics and gating mechanisms have been analyzed, and modeled, in exquisite detail (Hille, 2001). Inward rectifier K (Kir) channels have received less attention, and perusal of the literature indicates that there is still no common understanding of kinetic mechanisms in Kir channels. It is our contention, however, that one is in reach. Amongst Kir channels, ATP-sensitive (KATP) channels are uniquely regulated by cytoplasmic nucleotides and specific pharmacological agents. As such, they play a critical role in coupling cellular metabolism to electrical activity, and are major drug targets in pancreatic, vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle (Ashcroft, 1988; Nichols and Lederer, 1991). We would argue that these unique properties also permit elucidation of important features of channel gating that are relevant to the whole class of Kir channels. The molecular mechanisms of KATP channel regulation have occupied many groups for the last twenty years. Kinetic measurements have led to mathematical models of gating, mutagenesis has indicated relevant molecular elements, and crystallization of various K channel subunits and domains now provides templates for the channel structure. Distilling a consistent model of channel activity and regulation from this broth of data is the challenge for the field, and the topic of this Brief Review.},

Channel closure is facilitated by ATP, which binds to the pore-forming subunit (Kir6.2). Conversely, channel opening is potentiated by phosphoinositol bisphosphate (PIP2), which binds to Kir6.2 and reduces channel inhibition by ATP. Here, we use homology modelling and ligand docking to identify the PIP2-binding site on Kir6.2. The model is consistent with a large amount of functional data and was further tested by mutagenesis. The fatty acyl tails of PIP2 lie within the membrane and the head group extends downwards to interact with residues in the N terminus (K39, N41, R54), transmembrane domains (K67) and C terminus (R176, R177, E179, R301) of Kir6.2. Our model suggests how PIP2 increases channel opening and decreases ATP binding and channel inhibition. It is likely to be applicable to the PIP2-binding site of other Kir channels, as the residues identified are conserved and influence PIP2 sensitivity in other Kir channel family members.},

At the single-channel current level, ATP-dependent gating transitions between the active burst and the inactive interburst conformations underlie inhibition of the KATP channel by intracellular ATP. Previously, we identified a slow gating mutation, T171A in the Kir6.2 subunit, which dramatically reduces rates of burst to interburst transitions in Kir6.2ΔC26 channels without SUR1 in the absence of ATP. Here, we constructed all possible mutations at position 171 in Kir6.2ΔC26 channels without SUR1. Only four substitutions, 171A, 171F, 171H, and 171S, gave rise to functional channels, each increasing Ki,ATP for ATP inhibition by {\textgreater}55-fold and slowing gating to the interburst by {\textgreater}35-fold. Moreover, we investigated the role of individual Kir6.2 subunits in the gating by comparing burst to interburst transition rates of channels constructed from different combinations of slow 171A and fast T171 “wild-type” subunits. The relationship between gating transition rate and number of slow subunits is exponential, which excludes independent gating models where any one subunit is sufficient for inhibition gating. Rather, our results support mechanisms where four ATP sites independently can control a single gate formed by the concerted action of all four Kir6.2 subunit inner helices of the KATP channel.},

The inhibitory action of ATP is mediated by at least two distinct functional domains within the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of Kir6.2. The G334D mutation of Kir6.2 virtually eliminates ATP-dependent gating with no effect on ligand-independent gating, suggesting a role in linkage of the site to the gate or in the ATP binding site, itself. The T171A mutation of Kir6.2 strongly disrupts both ATP-dependent and ligand-independent gating, suggesting a role for T171 in the gating step. A neighboring mutation, I182Q, virtually eliminates ATP inhibition, but its effect on ligand-independent gating remained unknown. We have now characterized both the Ki values for inhibition by ATP and the ligand-independent gating kinetics of 15 substitutions at position 182. All substitutions decreased ATP-dependent inhibition gating as measured by the Ki, many profoundly so, yet had little or no effect on ligand-independent gating kinetics. Thus, substitutions at position 182 are unlikely to act by disrupting inhibition gate movement. Our results indicate an indispensable role for I182 in a step of the ATP binding mechanism, the linkage mechanism coupling the ATP binding site to the inhibition gate, or both.},

All of the KATP channel mutations examined result in decreased ATP inhibition, which in turn is predicted to suppress insulin secretion. Here we describe a patient with severe PNDM, which includes developmental delay and epilepsy, in addition to neonatal diabetes (developmental delay, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes [DEND]), due to a G334D mutation in the Kir6.2 subunit of KATP channel. The patient was wholly unresponsive to sulfonylurea therapy (up to 1.14 mg · kg−1 · day−1) and remained insulin dependent. Consistent with the putative role of G334 as an ATP-binding residue, reconstituted homomeric and mixed WT+G334D channels exhibit absent or reduced ATP sensitivity but normal gating behavior in the absence of ATP. In disagreement with the sulfonylurea insensitivity of the affected patient, the G334D mutation has no effect on the sulfonylurea inhibition of reconstituted channels in excised patches. However, in macroscopic rubidium-efflux assays in intact cells, reconstituted mutant channels do exhibit a decreased, but still present, sulfonylurea response. The results demonstrate that ATP-binding site mutations can indeed cause DEND and suggest the possibility that sulfonylurea insensitivity of such patients may be a secondary reflection of the presence of DEND rather than a simple reflection of the underlying molecular basis.},

Intricate interactions between TMD0, the loop following TMD0, and Kir6.2 near the proposed PIP2 binding site, and where ATP density is observed, suggest SUR1 may contribute to ATP and PIP2 binding to enhance Kir6.2 sensitivity to both. The SUR1-ABC core is found in an unusual inward-facing conformation whereby the two nucleotide binding domains are misaligned along a two-fold symmetry axis, revealing a possible mechanism by which glibenclamide inhibits channel activity.},

These structures, referred to as quatrefoil and propeller forms, were determined by single-particle cryo-EM at 3.9 Å and 5.6 Å, respectively. In both forms, ATP occupies the inhibitory site in Kir6.2. The nucleotide-binding domains of SUR1 are dimerized with Mg2+-ATP in the degenerate site and Mg2+-ADP in the consensus site. A lasso extension forms an interface between SUR1 and Kir6.2 adjacent to the ATP site in the propeller form and is disrupted in the quatrefoil form.

	abstract = {The ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP channel) couples blood levels of glucose to insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells. KATP channel closure triggers a cascade of events that results in insulin release. Metabolically generated changes in the intracellular concentrations of adenosine nucleotides are integral to this regulation, with ATP and ADP closing the channel and MgATP and MgADP increasing channel activity. Activating mutations in the genes encoding either of the two types of KATP channel subunit (Kir6.2 and SUR1) result in neonatal diabetes mellitus, whereas loss-of-function mutations cause hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia of infancy. Sulfonylurea and glinide drugs, which bind to SUR1, close the channel through a pathway independent of ATP and are now the primary therapy for neonatal diabetes mellitus caused by mutations in the genes encoding KATP channel subunits. Insight into the molecular details of drug and nucleotide regulation of channel activity has been illuminated by cryo-electron microscopy structures that reveal the atomic-level organization of the KATP channel complex. Here we review how these structures aid our understanding of how the various mutations in the genes encoding Kir6.2 (KCNJ11) and SUR1 (ABCC8) lead to a reduction in ATP inhibition and thereby neonatal diabetes mellitus. We also provide an update on known mutations and sulfonylurea therapy in neonatal diabetes mellitus.},

We investigated the interactions between MgATP, MgADP, and the sulphonylurea gliclazide with KATP channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. In the absence of MgATP, gliclazide block was similar for wild-type channels and those carrying the Kir6.2 ND mutations R210C, G334D, I296L, and V59M. Gliclazide abolished the stimulatory effect of MgATP on all channels. Conversely, high MgATP concentrations reduced the gliclazide concentration, producing a half-maximal block of G334D and R201C channels and suggesting a mutual antagonism between nucleotide and gliclazide binding. The maximal extent of high-affinity gliclazide block of wild-type channels was increased by MgATP, but this effect was smaller for ND channels; channels that were least sensitive to ATP inhibition showed the smallest increase in sulphonylurea block. Consequently, G334D and I296L channels were not fully blocked, even at physiological MgATP concentrations (1 mmol/L). Glibenclamide block was also reduced in β-cells expressing Kir6.2-V59M channels. These data help to explain why patients with some mutations (e.g., G334D, I296L) are insensitive to sulphonylurea therapy, why higher drug concentrations are needed to treat ND than type 2 diabetes, and why patients with severe ND mutations are less prone to drug-induced hypoglycemia.},

	abstract = {Major advances have been made on the inhibition gate and ATP site of the Kir6.2 subunit of the KATP channel, but little is known about conformational coupling between the two. ATP site mutations dramatically disrupt ATP-dependent gating without effect on ligand-independent gating, observed as interconversions between active burst and inactive interburst conformations in the absence of ATP. This suggests that linkage between site and gate is conditionally dependent on ATP occupancy. We studied all substitutions at position 334 of the ATP site in Kir6.2ΔC26 that express in Xenopus oocytes. All substitutions disrupted ATP-dependent gating by 10-fold or more. Only positive-charged arginine or lysine at 334, however, slowed ligand-independent gating from the burst, and this was in some but not all patches. Moreover, the polycationic peptide protamine reversed the slowed gating from the burst of 334R mutant channels, and speeded the slow gating from the burst of wild-type SUR1/Kir6.2 in the absence of ATP. Our results support a two-step ligand-dependent linkage mechanism for Kir6.2 channels in which ATP-occupied sites function to electrostatically dissociate COOH-terminal domains from the membrane, then as in all Kir channels, free COOH-terminal domains and inner M2 helices transit to a lower energy state for gate closure.},

	abstract = {A physiological role for long-chain acyl-CoA esters to activate ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels is well established. Circulating palmitate is transported into cells and converted to palmitoyl-CoA, which is a substrate for palmitoylation. We found that palmitoyl-CoA, but not palmitic acid, activated the channel when applied acutely. We have altered the palmitoylation state by preincubating cells with micromolar concentrations of palmitic acid or by inhibiting protein thioesterases. With acyl-biotin exchange assays we found that Kir6.2, but not sulfonylurea receptor (SUR)1 or SUR2, was palmitoylated. These interventions increased the KATP channel mean patch current, increased the open time, and decreased the apparent sensitivity to ATP without affecting surface expression. Similar data were obtained in transfected cells, rat insulin-secreting INS-1 cells, and isolated cardiac myocytes. Kir6.2ΔC36, expressed without SUR, was also positively regulated by palmitoylation. Mutagenesis of Kir6.2 Cys166 prevented these effects. Clinical variants in KCNJ11 that affect Cys166 had a similar gain-of-function phenotype, but was more pronounced. Molecular modeling studies suggested that palmitoyl-C166 and selected large hydrophobic mutations make direct hydrophobic contact with Kir6.2-bound PIP2. Patch-clamp studies confirmed that palmitoylation of Kir6.2 at Cys166 enhanced the PIP2 sensitivity of the channel. Physiological relevance is suggested since palmitoylation blunted the regulation of KATP channels by α1-adrenoreceptor stimulation. The Cys166 residue is conserved in some other Kir family members (Kir6.1 and Kir3, but not Kir2), which are also subject to regulated palmitoylation, suggesting a general mechanism to control the open state of certain Kir channels.},

Kir6.2 is expressed in muscle, neuron and brain as well as the pancreatic beta-cell, so patients with KCNJ11 mutations could have a neurological phenotype in addition to their diabetes. It is proposed that some patients with KCNJ11 mutations have neurological features that are part of a discrete neurological syndrome termed developmental Delay, Epilepsy and Neonatal Diabetes (DEND), but there are also neurological consequences of chronic or acute diabetes. We identified KCNJ11 mutations in four of 10 probands with permanent neonatal diabetes and one affected parent; this included the novel C166F mutation and the previously described V59M and R201H. Four of the five patients with mutations had neurological features: the patient with the C166F mutation had marked developmental delay, severe generalised epilepsy, hypotonia and muscle weakness; mild developmental delay was present in the patient with the V59M mutation; one patient with the R201H mutation had acute and chronic neurological consequences of cerebral oedema and another had diabetic neuropathy from chronic hyperglycaemia. In conclusion, the clinical features in these patients support the existence of a discrete neurological syndrome with KCNJ11 mutations. The severe DEND syndrome was seen with the novel C166F mutation and mild developmental delay with the V59M mutation. These features differ markedly from the neurological consequences of acute or chronic diabetes.},

The severity of the clinical symptoms is reflected in the ATP sensitivity of heterozygous channels in vitro with wild type {\textgreater} transient neonatal diabetes {\textgreater} permanent neonatal diabetes {\textgreater} DEND syndrome channels. Sulfonylureas still close mutated KATP channels, and many patients can discontinue insulin injections and show improved glycemic control when treated with high-dose sulfonylurea tablets.

	abstract = {KATPchannels are heteromultimers of a sulfonylurea receptor SUR and KIR6.2 with the inward rectifier forming the pore which is regulated by SUR. We have examined the contributions of the cytoplasmic domains of KIR6.2 to control of spontaneous bursting and ATP-inhibition in human SUR1/KIR6.2 KATPchannels. Truncations of the N-terminus of KIR6.2 nearly eliminate transitions to interburst closed states without affecting the open or intraburst closed states, thus producing SUR1/ΔNKIR6.2 channels with an extremely high open probability in the absence of nucleotides. These channels have a decrease apparent ATP-sensitivity which is consistent with the involvement of the N-terminus in a transition to an interburst closed state that preferentially binds inhibitory ATP. Mutations in both the N- and proximal C-termini of KIR6.2 can synergistically attenuate the ATP-inhibition. The results identify the N-terminus of KIR6.2 as a determinant of the interburst kinetics of KATPchannels and suggest that the two cytoplasmic domains of KIR6.2 participate in ATP-inhibitory gating through distinct mechanisms.},

	abstract = {ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels are reversibly inhibited by intracellular ATP. Agents that interact with sulfhydryl moieties produce an irreversible inhibition of KATP channel activity when applied to the intracellular membrane surface. ATP appears to protect against this effect, suggesting that the cysteine residue with which thiol reagents interact may either lie within the ATP-binding site or be inaccessible when the channel is closed. We have examined the interaction of the membrane-impermeant thiol-reactive agent p-chloromercuriphenylsulphonate (pCMPS) with the cloned β cell KATP channel. This channel comprises the pore-forming Kir6.2 and regulatory SUR1 subunits. We show that the cysteine residue involved in channel inhibition by pCMPS resides on the Kir6.2 subunit and is located at position 42, which lies within the NH2 terminus of the protein. Although ATP protects against the effects of pCMPS, the ATP sensitivity of the KATP channel was unchanged by mutation of C42 to either valine (V) or alanine (A), suggesting that ATP does not interact directly with this residue. These results are consistent with the idea that C42 is inaccessible to the intracellular solution, and thereby protected from interaction with pCMPS when the channel is closed by ATP. We also observed that the C42A mutation does not affect the ability of SUR1 to endow Kir6.2 with diazoxide sensitivity, and reduces, but does not prevent, the effects of MgADP and tolbutamide, which are mediated via SUR1. The Kir6.2-C42A (or V) mutant channel may provide a suitable background for cysteine-scanning mutagenesis studies.},

	abstract = {ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels are heteromultimeric complexes of an inwardly rectifying Kir channel (Kir6.x) and sulfonylurea receptors. Their regulation by intracellular ATP and ADP generates electrical signals in response to changes in cellular metabolism. We investigated channel elements that control the kinetics of ATP-dependent regulation of KATP (Kir6.2 + SUR1) channels using rapid concentration jumps. WT Kir6.2 channels re-open after rapid washout of ATP with a time constant of ∼60 ms. Extending similar kinetic measurements to numerous mutants revealed fairly modest effects on gating kinetics despite significant changes in ATP sensitivity and open probability. However, we identified a pair of highly conserved neighboring amino acids (Trp-68 and Lys-170) that control the rate of channel opening and inhibition in response to ATP. Paradoxically, mutations of Trp-68 or Lys-170 markedly slow the kinetics of channel opening (500 and 700 ms for W68L and K170N, respectively), while increasing channel open probability. Examining the functional effects of these residues using φ value analysis revealed a steep negative slope. This finding implies that these residues play a role in lowering the transition state energy barrier between open and closed channel states. Using unnatural amino acid incorporation, we demonstrate the requirement for a planar amino acid at Kir6.2 position 68 for normal channel gating, which is potentially necessary to localize the ϵ-amine of Lys-170 in the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-binding site. Overall, our findings identify a discrete pair of highly conserved residues with an essential role for controlling gating kinetics of Kir channels.
Background:
Kir6.2 potassium channels are regulated by ATP.
Results:
We measured Kir6.2 gating kinetics in response to rapid ATP concentration jumps. Mutations to Trp-68 and Lys-170 dramatically decelerate gating.
Conclusion:
Trp-68 and Lys-170 interact to form a cluster that enables rapid gating transitions.
Significance:
The Trp-68/Lys-170 cluster is highly conserved and may play a similar role in other Kir channels.},

Mutations of residue G53 underlie both mild (G53R,S) and severe (G53D) forms of the disease. All examined substitutions (G53D,R,S,A,C,F) reduced ATP-sensitivity, indicating an intolerance of any amino acid other than glycine. Surprisingly, each mutation reduces ATP affinity, rather than intrinsic gating, although structural modeling places G53 at a significant distance from the ATP-binding pocket. We propose that glycine is required in this location for flexibility of the distal N-terminus, and for an induced fit of ATP at the binding site. Consistent with this hypothesis, glycine substitution of the adjacent residue (Q52G) partially rescues ATP affinity of reconstituted Q52G/G53D channels. The results reveal an important feature of the noncanonical ATP-sensing mechanism of KATP channels.},

We investigated the molecular mechanisms that link ligand binding to the channel gate in ATP-sensitive Kir6.2 channels. In these channels, the “slide helix” forms an interface between the cytoplasmic (ligand-binding) domain and the transmembrane pore, and many slide helix mutations cause loss of function. Using a novel approach to rescue electrically silent channels, we decomposed the contribution of each interface residue to ATP-dependent gating. We demonstrate that effective inhibition by ATP relies on an essential aspartate at residue 58. Characterization of the functional importance of this conserved aspartate, relative to other residues in the slide helix, has been impossible because of loss-of-function of Asp-58 mutant channels. The Asp-58 position exhibits an extremely stringent requirement for aspartate because even a highly conservative mutation to glutamate is insufficient to restore normal channel function. These findings reveal unrecognized slide helix elements that are required for functional channel expression and control of Kir6.2 gating by intracellular ATP. Background: Kir6.2 potassium channels are inhibited by intracellular ATP. Results: A rescue mechanism was applied to loss-of-function channel mutations. Asp-58 mutations in an interfacial helix (the “slide” helix) abolish ATP sensitivity. Conclusion: Residue Asp-58 is essential for coupling Kir6.2 channel cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains.

We studied the closed ⇌ open conformational change at the single-molecule level following perturbation by series of single-site mutations, agonists and membrane voltages. This method provided a snapshot of several regions of the receptor at the transition state in terms of their approximate positions along the reaction coordinate, on a scale from 0 (closed-like) to 1 (open-like). The resulting map reveals a spatial gradient of positional values, which suggests that the conformational change proceeds in a wave-like manner, with the low-to-high affinity change at the transmitter-binding sites preceding the complete opening of the pore.},

A truncated isoform of Kir6.2, Kir6.2ΔC26, expresses ATP-sensitive channels in the absence of SUR1, suggesting the ATP-inhibitory site lies on the Kir6.2 subunit. 2 We examined the effect on the channel ATP sensitivity of mutating the arginine residue at position 50 (R50) in the N-terminus of Kir6.2, by recording macroscopic currents in membrane patches excised from Xenopus oocytes expressing wild-type or mutant Kir6.2ΔC26. 3 Substitution of R50 by serine, alanine or glycine reduced the Ki for ATP inhibition from 117 μm to 800 μm, 1.1 mm and 3.8 mm, respectively. The single-channel conductance and kinetics were unaffected by any of these mutations. Mutation to glutamate, lysine, asparagine, glutamine or leucine had a smaller effect (Ki, ∼300–400 μm). The results indicate that the side chain of the arginine residue at position 50 is unlikely to contribute directly to the binding site for ATP, and suggest it may affect ATP inhibition by allosteric interactions. 4 Mutation of the isoleucine residue at position 49 to glycine (I49G) reduced the channel ATP sensitivity, while the mutation of the glutamate residue at position 51 to glycine (E51G) did not. 5 When a mutation in the N-terminus of Kir6.2ΔC26 that alters ATP sensitivity (R50S; Ki, 800 μm) was combined with one in the C-terminus (E179Q; Ki, 300 μm), the Ki for the apparent ATP sensitivity was increased to 2.8 mm. The Hill coefficient was also increased. This suggests that the N- and C-termini of Kir6.2 may co-operate to influence channel closure by ATP.},

	abstract = {Many ion channels are modulated by multiple stimuli, which allow them to integrate a variety of cellular signals and precisely respond to physiological needs. Understanding how these different signaling pathways interact has been a challenge in part because of the complexity of underlying models. In this study, we analyzed the energetic relationships in polymodal ion channels using linkage principles. We first show that in proteins dually modulated by voltage and ligand, the net free-energy change can be obtained by measuring the charge-voltage (Q-V) relationship in zero ligand condition and the ligand binding curve at highly depolarizing membrane voltages. Next, we show that the voltage-dependent changes in ligand occupancy of the protein can be directly obtained by measuring the Q-V curves at multiple ligand concentrations. When a single reference ligand binding curve is available, this relationship allows us to reconstruct ligand binding curves at different voltages. More significantly, we establish that the shift of the Q-V curve between zero and saturating ligand concentration is a direct estimate of the interaction energy between the ligand- and voltage-dependent pathway. These free-energy relationships were tested by numerical simulations of a detailed gating model of the BK channel. Furthermore, as a proof of principle, we estimate the interaction energy between the ligand binding and voltage-dependent pathways for HCN2 channels whose ligand binding curves at various voltages are available. These emerging principles will be useful for high-throughput mutagenesis studies aimed at identifying interaction pathways between various regulatory domains in a polymodal ion channel.},

The mutations do not change the channel open probability (Po) in the absence of ATP, supporting the involvement of these residues in ATP binding. We recently proposed that at least two of these positively charged residues, K185 and R201, interact with ATP phosphate groups to cause channel closure: the β phosphate group of ATP interacts with K185 to initiate closure, while the α phosphate interacts with R201 to stabilize the channel's closed state. In the present study we replaced these three positive residues with residues of different charge, size and hydropathy. For K185 and R201, we found that charge, more than any other property, controls the interaction of ATP with Kir6.2. At these positions, replacement with another positive residue had minor effects on ATP sensitivity. In contrast, replacement of K185 with a negative residue (K185D/E) decreased ATP sensitivity much more than neutral substitutions, suggesting that an electrostatic interaction between the β phosphate group of ATP and K185 destabilizes the open state of the channel. At R201, replacement with a negative charge (R201E) had multiple effects, decreasing ATP sensitivity and preventing full channel closure at high concentrations. In contrast, the R50E mutation had a modest effect on ATP sensitivity, and only residues such as proline and glycine that affect protein structure caused major decreases in ATP sensitivity at the R50 position. Based on these results and the recently published structure of Kir3.1 cytoplasmic domain, we propose a scheme where binding of the β phosphate group of ATP to K185 induces a motion of the surrounding region, which destabilizes the open state, favouring closure of the M2 gate. Binding of the α phosphate group of ATP to R201 then stabilizes the closed state. R50 on the N-terminus controls ATP binding by facilitating the interaction of the β phosphate group of ATP with K185 to destabilize the open state.},

	abstract = {Background Different tests were applied to test the sensitivity of patient self-control; Amsler grid and visual acuity (VA) assessment, as well as fundus examinations to reveal recurrent choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) activity in age-related macular degeneration as detected by spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in monthly controls.
Methods A prospective interventional case series of patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration was examined, which received ranibizumab injections until complete resolution of fluid in SD-OCT. Analysis of changes in subjective perception, Amsler grid, early treatment diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) VA, Radner reading VA and fundus examination was conducted in the case of OCT-confirmed CNV recurrences.
Results Out of 40 morphological recurrences determined by SD-OCT, six (15\%) were noticed by subjective patient perception. Amsler grid testing revealed deterioration in 12 cases (30\%); 11 recurrences (28\%) were accompanied by loss of ≥5 letters in ETDRS VA and/or ≥1 line in Radner VA; fundus examination showed signs of novel CNV activity in 10 out of 40 recurrences (25\%). The combined sensitivity of all diagnostic methods compared to SD-OCT for recurrence detection was 67.5\% (27 out of 40 recurrences).
Conclusion Subjective patient perception, Amsler grid, VA as well as fundus examination lead to pronounced underestimations of CNV recurrences. Morphologic recurrences can be detected prior to functional deterioration. As any delay of treatment can result in irreversible vision loss, attempts should be made to provide monthly OCT controls to detect recurrences as early as possible.},

	abstract = {The determination of optical coherence tomography (OCT) central subfield thickness (CST) is an objective measure, and visual acuity (VA) is a subjective measure. Therefore, using OCT CST changes as a surrogate for VA changes in diabetic macular edema seems reasonable. However, studies suggest that change in OCT CST following anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment for diabetic macular edema is correlated with changes in VA but varies substantially among individuals, and so may not be a good surrogate for changes in VA.To determine associations between changes in VA and changes in OCT CST across 3 anti-VEGF agents (aflibercept, bevacizumab, or ranibizumab) used in a randomized clinical trial for diabetic macular edema.Post hoc analyses were conducted of DRCR Retina Network Protocol T among 652 of 660 participants (98.8\%) meeting inclusion criteria for this investigation. The study was conducted between August 22, 2012, and September 23, 2015. The post hoc data collection and analysis were performed from May 29 to July 11, 2018.Six monthly intravitreous anti-VEGF injections (unless success was achieved after 3-5 months) were administered; subsequent injections or focal/grid laser photocoagulation treatments were given as needed per protocol to achieve stability.Association between changes in VA letter score with changes in CST at 12, 52, and 104 weeks after randomization to aflibercept, bevacizumab, or ranibizumab.Of the 652 participants, 304 were women (46.6\%); median age was 61 years (interquartile range, 54-67 years). The correlation between CST and VA at the follow-up visits was 0.24 (95\% CI, 0.16-0.31) in 616 patients at 12 weeks, 0.31 (95\% CI, 0.24-0.38) in 609 patients at 52 weeks, and 0.23 (95\% CI, 0.15-0.31) in 566 patients at 104 weeks. The correlation coefficients of change in VA vs change in OCT CST for these time intervals were 0.36 (95\% CI, 0.29-0.43) at 12 weeks, 0.36 (95\% CI, 0.29-0.43) at 52 weeks, and 0.33 (95\% CI, 0.26-0.41) at 104 weeks.Changes in CST appear to account for only a small proportion of the total variation in changes in VA. These findings do not support using changes in OCT CST as a surrogate for changes in VA in phase 3 clinical trials evaluating anti-VEGF for diabetic macular edema or as a guide to inform the physician or patient about changes in VA after anti-VEGF treatment.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01627249},

These channels play crucial roles in many essential physiological processes and have been implicated extensively in a spectrum of metabolic diseases and disorders. To gain insight into the mechanism of KATP, we elucidated the structure of a hetero-octameric pancreatic KATP channel in complex with a non-competitive inhibitor glibenclamide by single-particle cryoelectron microscopy to 5.6-Å resolution. The structure shows that four SUR1 regulatory subunits locate peripherally and dock onto the central Kir6.2 channel tetramer through the SUR1 TMD0-L0 fragment. Glibenclamide-bound SUR1 uses TMD0-L0 fragment to stabilize Kir6.2 channel in a closed conformation. In another structural population, a putative co-purified phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) molecule uncouples Kir6.2 from glibenclamide-bound SUR1. These structural observations suggest a molecular mechanism for KATP regulation by anti-diabetic sulfonylurea drugs, intracellular adenosine nucleotide concentrations, and PIP2 lipid.},

This issue has been difficult to address because there is no indicator of cytosolic ATP, such as those available for Ca2+, capable of resolving the submembrane ATP concentration ([ATP]sm) in real time within a single cell. We show here that mutant ATP-sensitive K+ channels can be used to measure [ATP]sm by comparing the increase in current amplitude on patch excision with the ATP dose-response curve. In Xenopus oocytes, [ATP]sm was 4.6 ± 0.3 mm (n = 29) under resting conditions, slightly higher than that measured for the bulk cytoplasm (2.3 mm). In mammalian (COSm6) cells, [ATP]smwas slightly lower and averaged 1.4 ± 0.1 mm(n = 66). Metabolic poisoning (10 min of 3 mm azide) produced a significant fall in [ATP]sm in both types of cells: to 1.2 ± 0.1 mm (n = 24) in oocytes and 0.8 ± 0.11 mm for COSm6 cells. We conclude that [ATP]sm lies in the low millimolar range and that there is no gradient between bulk cytosolic and submembrane [ATP].},

Using cadmium ions as a cysteine-interacting probe, we examined the accessibility of substituted cysteines in M2 of the Kir6.2 subunit of inwardly rectifying KATP channels. The ability of Cd2+ ions to inhibit channels was used as the estimate of accessibility. The distribution of Cd2+ accessibility is consistent with an α-helical structure of M2. The apparent surface of reactivity is broad, and the most reactive residues correspond to the solvent-accessible residues in the bacterial KcsA channel crystal structure. In several mutants, single channel measurements indicated that inhibition occurred by a single transition from the open state to a zero-conductance state. Analysis of currents expressed from mixtures of control and L164C mutant subunits indicated that at least three cysteines are required for coordination of the Cd2+ ion. Application of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate to inside-out membrane patches stabilized the open state of all mutants and also reduced cadmium sensitivity. Moreover, the Cd2+ sensitivity of several mutants was greatly reduced in the presence of inhibitory ATP concentrations. Taken together, these results are consistent with state-dependent accessibility of single Cd2+ions to coordination sites within a relatively narrow inner vestibule.},

	abstract = {ATP-sensitive K+ channels composed of the pore-forming protein Kir6.2 and the sulphonylurea receptor SUR1 are inhibited by ATP and activated by Phosphatidylinositol Bisphosphate (PIP2). Residues involved in binding of these ligands to the Kir6.2 cytoplasmic domain have been identified, and it has been hypothesized that gating mechanisms involve conformational changes in the regions of the bundle crossing and/or the selectivity filter of Kir6.2. Regulation of Kir6.2 by SUR1, however, is not well-understood, even though this process is ATP and PIP2 dependent. In this study, we investigated the relationship between channel regulation by SUR1 and PIP2 by comparing a number of single and double mutants known to affect open probability (Po), PIP2 affinity, and sulphonylurea and MgADP sensitivity. When coexpressed with SUR1, the Kir6.2 mutant C166A, which is characterized by a Po value close to 0.8, exhibits no sulphonylurea or MgADP sensitivity. However, when Po was reduced by combining mutations at the PIP2-sensitive residues R176 and R177 with C166A, sulphonylurea and MgADP sensitivities were restored. These effects correlated with a dramatic decrease in PIP2 affinity, as assessed by PIP2-induced channel reactivation and inhibition by neomycin, an antagonist of PIP2 binding. Based on macroscopic and single-channel data, we propose a model in which entry into the high-Po bursting state by the C166A mutation or by SUR1 depends on the interaction of PIP2 with R176 and R177 and, to a lesser extent, R54. In conjunction with this PIP2-dependent process, SUR1 also regulates channel activity via a PIP2-independent, but MgADP-dependent process.},

We demonstrate that Kir6.2 can be directly labeled by 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP but that the related subunit Kir4.1, which is not inhibited by ATP, is not labeled. Photoaffinity labeling of Kir6.2 is reduced by approximately 50\% with 100 μm ATP. In addition, mutations in the NH2 terminus (R50G) and the COOH terminus (K185Q) of Kir6.2, which have both been shown to reduce the inhibitory effect of ATP upon Kir6.2 channel activity, reduced photoaffinity labeling by {\textgreater}50\%. These results demonstrate that ATP binds directly to Kir6.2 and that both the NH2- and COOH-terminal intracellular domains may influence ATP binding.},

	abstract = {The ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel is named after its characteristic inhibition by intracellular ATP. The inhibition is a centerpiece of how the KATP channel sets electrical signaling to the energy state of the cell. In the β cell of the endocrine pancreas, for example, ATP inhibition results from high blood glucose levels and turns on electrical activity leading to insulin release. The underlying gating mechanism (ATP inhibition gating) includes ATP stabilization of closed states, but the action of ATP on the open state of the channel is disputed. The original models of ATP inhibition gating proposed that ATP directly binds the open state, whereas recent models indicate a prerequisite transition from the open to a closed state before ATP binds and inhibits activity. We tested these two classes of models by using kinetic analysis of single-channel currents from the cloned mouse pancreatic KATP channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes. In particular, we combined gating models based on fundamental rate law and burst gating kinetic considerations. The results demonstrate open-state ATP dependence as the major mechanism by which ATP speeds exit from the active burst state underlying inhibition of the KATP channel by ATP.},

The “gatekeepers” of the long, ATP-inhibited KIR6.0 pores of KATP channels are ABC proteins, SURs, receptors for channel opening and closing drugs. Several competing models for SUR/KIR coupling exist. We show that SUR TMD0, the N-terminal bundle of five transmembrane helices, specifically associates with KIR6.2, forcing nearly silent pores to burst like native KATP channels and enhancing surface expression. Inclusion of adjacent submembrane residues of L0, the linker between TMD0 and the stimulatory nucleotide- and drug-binding ABC core, generates constitutively active channels, whereas additional cytoplasmic residues counterbalance this activation establishing a relationship between the mean open and burst times of intact pores. SUR fragments, lacking TMD0, fail to modulate KIR. TMD0 is thus the domain that anchors SUR to the KIR pore. Consistent with data on chimeric ABCC/KIRs and a modeled channel structure, we propose that interactions of TMD0-L0 with the outer helix and N terminus of KIR bidirectionally modulate gating. The results explain and predict pathologies associated with alteration of the 5′ ends of clustered ABCC8 (9)/KCNJ11 (8) genes.},

Although SUR is an important regulator of Kir6, the specific SUR domain that associates with Kir6 is still unknown. All functional ABC proteins contain two transmembrane domains but some, including SUR and MRP1 (multidrug resistance protein 1), contain an extra N-terminal transmembrane domain called TMD0. The functions of any TMD0s are largely unclear. Using Xenopus oocytes to coexpress truncated SUR constructs with Kir6, we demonstrated by immunoprecipitation, single-oocyte chemiluminescence and electrophysiological measurements that the TMD0 of SUR1 strongly associated with Kir6.2 and modulated its trafficking and gating. Two TMD0 mutations, A116P and V187D, previously correlated with persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy, were found to disrupt the association between TMD0 and Kir6.2. These results underscore the importance of TMD0 in KATP channel function, explaining how specific mutations within this domain result in disease, and suggest how an ABC protein has evolved to regulate a potassium channel.},

	abstract = {ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels comprise four pore-forming Kir6 and four regulatory sulphonylurea receptor (SUR) subunits. SUR, an ATP-binding cassette protein, associates with Kir6 through its N-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD0). TMD0 connects to the core domain of SUR through a cytosolic linker (L0). The intrinsic gating of Kir6.2 is greatly altered by SUR. It has been hypothesized that these changes are conferred by TMD0. Exploiting the fact that the pancreatic (SUR1/Kir6.2) and the cardiac (SUR2A/Kir6.2) KATP channels show different gating behaviours, we have tested this hypothesis by comparing the intrinsic gating of Kir6.2 with the last 26 residues deleted (Kir6.2Δ26) co-expressed with SUR1, S1-TMD0, SUR2A and S2-TMD0 at −40 and −100 mV (S is an abbreviation for SUR; TMD0/Kir6.2Δ26, but not TMD0/Kir6.2, can exit the endoplastic reticulum and reach the cell membrane). Single-channel kinetic analyses revealed that the mean burst and interburst durations are shorter for TMD0/Kir6.2Δ26 than for the corresponding SUR channels. No differences were found between the two TMD0 channels. We further demonstrated that in isolation even TMD0-L0 (SUR truncated after L0) cannot confer the wild-type intrinsic gating to Kir6.2Δ26 and that swapping L0 (SUR truncated after L0)between SUR1 and SUR2A only partially exchanges their different intrinsic gating. Therefore, in addition to TMD0, L0 and the core domain also participate in determining the intrinsic gating of Kir6.2. However, TMD0 and L0 are responsible for the different gating patterns of full-length SUR1 and SUR2A channels. A kinetic model with one open and four closed states is presented to explain our results in a mechanistic context.},

Our studies of ATP-sensitive K+ channel (KATP) trafficking reveal an essential quality control function for a trafficking motif present in each of the α (Kir6.1/2) and β (SUR1) subunits of the KATP complex. We show that this novel motif for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention/retrieval is required at multiple stages of KATP assembly to restrict surface expression to fully assembled and correctly regulated octameric channels.

The sensitivity of the channel to different sulfonylureas depends on the SUR isoform. In particular, Kir6.2-SUR1 but not Kir6.2-SUR2A channels are blocked by tolbutamide with high affinity. We made chimeras between SUR1 and SUR2A to identify the region of the protein involved in high-affinity tolbutamide block. Chimeric SURs were coexpressed with Kir6.2 in Xenopus oocytes, and macroscopic currents were measured in inside-out membrane patches. High-affinity tolbutamide inhibition could be conferred on SUR2A by replacing transmembrane domains (TMs) 14-16 with the corresponding region of SUR1. Conversely, high-affinity tolbutamide inhibition of SUR1 was abolished by replacing TMs 13-16 with the corresponding SUR2A sequence, or by mutating a single serine residue within this region to tyrosine (S1237Y). Binding of [3H]glibenclamide to membranes expressing SUR1 was abolished concomitantly with the loss of high-affinity tolbutamide block. These results suggest that a site in the COOH-terminal set of TMs of the SUR1 subunit of the K(ATP) channel is involved in the binding of tolbutamide and glibenclamide.},

The beta-cell and cardiac muscle K(ATP) channels have recently been cloned and shown to possess a common pore-forming subunit (Kir6.2) but different sulfonylurea receptor subunits (SUR1 and SUR2A, respectively). We examined the mechanism underlying the tissue specificity of the sulfonylureas tolbutamide and glibenclamide, and the benzamido-derivative meglitinide, using cloned beta-cell (Kir6.2/SUR1) and cardiac (Kir6.2/SUR2A) K(ATP) channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Tolbutamide inhibited Kir6.2/SUR1 (Ki approximately 5 micromol/l), but not Kir6.2/SUR2A, currents with high affinity. Meglitinide produced high-affinity inhibition of both Kir6.2/SUR1 and Kir6.2/SUR2A currents (Kis approximately 0.3 micromol/l and approximately 0.5 micromol/l, respectively). Glibenclamide also blocked Kir6.2/SUR1 and Kir6.2/SUR2A currents with high affinity (Kis approximately 4 nmol/l and approximately 27 nmol/l, respectively); however, only for cardiac-type K(ATP) channels was this block reversible. Physiological concentrations of MgADP (100 micromol/l) enhanced glibenclamide inhibition of Kir6.2/SUR1 currents but reduced that of Kir6.2/SUR2A currents. The results suggest that SUR1 may possess separate high-affinity binding sites for sulfonylurea and benzamido groups. SUR2A, however, either does not possess a binding site for the sulfonylurea group or is unable to translate the binding at this site into channel inhibition. Although MgADP reduces the inhibitory effect of glibenclamide on cardiac-type K(ATP) channels, drugs that bind to the common benzamido site have the potential to cause side effects on the heart.},

However, the stoichiometry and arrangement of these subunits is unknown. Here we have used an approach based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to determine the composition of the intact functional channel in the surface membrane.
