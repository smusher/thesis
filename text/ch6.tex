\section{Introduction}
The SUR1 subunit exerts a number of different regulatory effects on the K\ATP{} channel.
Firstly, it dramatically enhances trafficking of Kir6.2 to the cell membrane by masking the endoplasmic retention motif in Kir6.2 (RKR).
Without coexpression with SUR1, Kir6.2 is confined to the endoplasmic reticulum.
Truncating the C-terminal by deleting the last 26 (Kir6.2-\textgreek{D}C26) or 36 (Kir6.2-\textgreek{D}C36) amino acids \cite{tucker_truncation_1997}, mutation of the RKR motif to AAA \cite{zerangue_new_1999}, or addition of a C-terminal GFP tag \cite{john_sulphonylurea_1998} are sufficient to allow expression of Kir6.2 at the membrane alone without the presence of SUR1.
Comparing the function of these modified Kir6.2 subunits alone to the function of octameric K\ATP{} channels makes it possible to discern the multifaceted roles of SUR1.
Crucially, these C-terminal modifications do not appear to alter K\ATP{} function when they are coexpressed with SUR1 \cite{tucker_truncation_1997, john_sulphonylurea_1998, ribalet_atp-sensitive_2006} and the cryo-EM structure solved for C-terminally GFP labelled Kir6.2 \cite{li_structure_2017} was highly similar to those solved without the GFP label \cite{martin_anti-diabetic_2017-1, lee_molecular_2017-1}.

Coexpression of SUR1 has two effects on K\ATP{} channel function.
Firstly, SUR1 increases the $P_O$ of the channel \cite{tucker_truncation_1997, john_sulphonylurea_1998, chan_n-terminal_2003-1}.
Expressing the TMD0 region of SUR1 (residues 1 - 195) alone is sufficient to recapitulate the increase in $P_O$ observed when full-length SUR1 is coexpressed\cite{babenko_sur_2003-1, chan_n-terminal_2003-1}.
When TMD0 is coexpressed with Kir6.2, there is additionally a decrease in the sensitivity of Kir6.2 to nucleotide inhibition - allosterically, an increase in $P_O$ would result in a decrease in apparent ATP affinity due to the reduction in stability of the closed state.
However, when full length SUR1 is coexpressed with Kir6.2, there is a marked increase in sensitivity to ATP inhibition \cite{tucker_truncation_1997, john_sulphonylurea_1998, chan_n-terminal_2003-1, ribalet_atp-sensitive_2006}.
This increase in sensitivity is not due to the L0 linker, the other domain of SUR1 postulated to make contacts with Kir6.2.
Expression of TMD0-L0 (residues 1 - 232) with Kir6.2 increases the $P_O$ to nearly saturating, and reduces ATP inhibition even further \cite{babenko_sur_2003-1}.
Increasing the fraction of L0 (up to residue number 256 or 288) attenuates this increase in $P_O$, but there is not the dramatic increase in ATP sensitivity observed from expression of full-length SUR1, implicating a role for the core region of SUR1 in regulating nuclelotide binding and inhibition \cite{puljung_cryo-electron_2018}.

\section{Intrinsic effects of SUR1}

\subsection{SUR1 dramatically alters nucleotide inhibition, but only subtly effects nucleotide binding}
Expressing WT-GFP alone without SUR1 results in smaller, noisier currents than when coexpressed with SUR1.
Currents are less sensitive to ATP and TNP-ATP by an order of magnitude (x and x).
Our surface expression assay suggested that while WT-GFP was able to reach the membrane in the absence of SUR1, W311*-GFP was not, and when we excised patches from cells expressing W311*-GFP alone, we were not able to resolve any currents.
We were still able to resolved fluorescence in unroofed membranes expressing W311*-GFP alone, and so we measured binding of TNP-ATP to W311*-GFP alone in unroofed membranes.
We observed very minimal differences in the EC\textsubscript{50} for binding.
However, given that we did not observe currents under these experimental conditions, we cannot determine the functional state of these channels and so this finding may not be representative for K\ATP{} channels physiologically.

Given that we were able to observe currents in the absence of SUR1, we confirmed that when SUR1 was cotransfected with our constructs we were measuring currents and fluorescence from correctly assembled K\ATP{} channels.
Firstly, we used tolbutamide to inhibit excised patches from cells expressing either WT-GFP alone, WT-GFP+SUR1 or W311*-GFP+SUR1.
Tolbutamide inhibition occurs at two sites on the K\ATP{} channel; a high affinity site on SUR1 and a low affinity site on Kir6.2 \cite{gribble_tissue_1998, ashfield_identification_1999}.
Inhibition occurring at these two sites can be well separated, with the high affinity site saturating at \SI{100}{\micro\Molar} tolbutamide at \SI{50}{\percent} fractional inhibition.
Tolbutamide inhibition of Kir6.2 expressed alone does not display inhibition until concentrations of over \SI{100}{\micro\Molar}.
When we expressed WT-GFP alone, we saw no inhibition of currents by \SI{100}{\micro\Molar}, whereas when we expressed WT-GFP+SUR1 or W311*-GFP+SUR1, we observed roughly a \SI{50}{\percent} fractional inhibition of current as expected for proper associated of Kir6.2 and SUR1.

In addition, we labelled the C-terminus of SUR1 with the fluorophore mOrange (SUR1-mO), and measured FRET between the GFP on WT-GFP or W311*-GFP and the mOrange on SUR1 in unroofed membranes.
The cryo-EM structures suggest a distance between the C-termini of Kir6.2 and SUR1 of roughly \SI{60}{\angstrom}, while the GFP-mOrange FRET pair has a theoretical R0 of \SI{54}{\angstrom}.
We would therefore expect to see FRET if our Kir6.2 and SUR1 contructs are coassembling.
To measure FRET, we used an approach described in \cite{zheng_rod_2002} whereby FRET is measured as an increase in the emission of the acceptor fluorophore (mOrange) on excitation of the donor fluorophore (GFP) (Figure \ref{sur_assays}).
We observed FRET between WT-GFP and SUR1-mO, consistent with the two subunits being in close proximity.
Less FRET was observed when W311*-GFP was coexpressed with SUR1-mO (although still much higher than background).
This is probably due to the reduced expression of W311*-GFP compared to WT-GFP, i.e. there is less donor fluorescence to transfer to mOrange.
Correcting for the magnitude of the GFP peak results in observed ratios for WT-GFP and W311*-GFP that are very similar.

\subsection{Presence of SUR1-TMD0 alone does not dramatically alter nucleotide binding}

We sought to clarify the role of the TMD0 and L0 regions of SUR1 in binding to the inhibitory nucleotide binding site of Kir6.2.
We used two SUR1 truncation constructs; TMD0 consisting of the N-terminal 1-195 residues of SUR1, and TMD0-L0 consisting of the N-terminal 1-232 residues of SUR1.
Firstly, we established whether these constructs were capable of supporting trafficking and expression at the cell membrane as previously reported \ref{babenko_sur_2003-1, chan_n-terminal_2003-1}.
In our luminesence based cell-surface expression assay, we found that TMD0 and TMD0-L0 increased the expression of WT-GFP approximately 3-fold over the expression of WT-GFP alone (Figure \ref{ch6fig:tmd0s_surface_expression_1}, \ref{ch6fig:tmd0s_surface_expression_2}).
This level of expression is somewhat less than observed for full-length SUR1.
However, when we coexpressed either TMD0 or TMD0-L0 with W311*-GFP, we found less evidence to suggest an increase of surface expression when compared to expression of W311*-GFP alone (Figure \ref{ch6fig:tmd0s_surface_expression_1}, \ref{ch6fig:tmd0s_surface_expression_3});
i.e., our posterior probability distributions for the fold increase in expression overlapped 1.
Indeed, when we attempted to excise patches coexpressing W311*-GFP and either TMD0 or TMD0-L0, we were unable to detect channel currents, while we were able to measure \si{\nano\ampere} currents from WT-GFP coexpressed with TMD0 or TMD0-L0.

Despite being unable to detect channel currents, as with W311*-GFP expressed alone, we were able to detect ANAP and GFP fluorescence from unroofed membrane patches coexpressing W311*-GFP with either TMD0 or TMD0-L0.
To determine whether this fluoresence was emitted from W311*-GFP coassembled with the truncated SUR1 constructs, we measured the emission ratio of TMD0-L0 labelled at the C-terminus with mOrange (TMD0-L0-mO) as described previously.
We coexpressed either WT-GFP or W311*-GFP with TMD0-L0-mO and measured the emission ratio of directly excited mOrange to indirectly excited mOrange in whole cells (Figure \ref{ch6fig:gfp_ofp_contrasts_2}).
For WT-GFP+TMD0-L0-mO, we observed an increase in emission ratio over TMD0-L0-mO of a similar magnitude for the increase observed for WT-GFP+SUR1-mO (Figure \ref{ch6fig:gfp_ofp_contrasts_1}).
This is consistent with TMD0-L0-mO coassembling with WT-GFP in unroofed membanes, as an increase in emission ratio requires the two fluorophores to be in close proximity.
However, 


We coexpressed both TMD0 and TMD0-L0 separately in combination with W311*-GFP and measured TNP-ATP binding in unroofed membranes (Figure \ref{ch6fig:tmd0s_unroofed_1}).

\section{SUR1 and nucleotide regulation}

\subsection{Mutations at SUR-K205 alter nucleotide binding and inhibition}

Residue K205 of SUR1 is located in the L0 region which links TMD0 and TMD1.
While expression of Kir6.2 and TMD0-L0 have shown that the region is important in modulating the $P_O$ of K\ATP{} channels \cite{babenko_sur_2003, chan_n-terminal_2003-1, pratt_n-terminal_2011}, it does not confer the high sensitivity to ATP inhibition seen in Kir6.2+SUR1 channels.
It has therefore been suggested that the elements of SUR1 which contribute to the higher sensitivity of K\ATP{} channels to ATP inhibition lie outside of this region \cite{babenko_sur_2003, pratt_engineered_2012-1}.
However, the cryo-EM structures of K\ATP{} suggest a close proximity between L0 and the ATP binding pocket \cite{martin_anti-diabetic_2017-1, lee_molecular_2017-1, li_structure_2017} and mutations in this region reduce the sensitivity of K\ATP{} to nucleotide inhibition \cite{ding_structural_2019,pratt_engineered_2012-1, masia_mutation_2007}.
Mutation of K205 to A \cite{ding_structural_2019} or E \cite{ding_structural_2019} have resulted in marked reduction of K\ATP{} channel sensitivity to nucleotide inhibition.
Why would mutation of this residue in L0 affect nucleotide inhibition given that expression of the L0 region does not in itself affect nucleotide inhibition?

We excised patches expressing W311*-GFP+SUR1-K205A or W311*-GFP+SUR1-K205E and measured current inhibition and fluorescence quenching by TNP-ATP simultaneously.
We found that both substitutions resulted in an increased IC\textsubscript{50} for TNP-ATP inhibition and an increased EC\textsubscript{50} for TNP-ATP binding, with K205E exhibiting a more pronounced effect than K205A.
Fitting the data to our MWC model gave parameter estimates for $K_A$ which were reduced when compared to wild-type SUR1; with the neutral mutation K205A not affecting $K_A$ quite as much as the charge reversal mutation K205E.
In addition, both mutations led to similar increases in $D$.
Thus, the reduced sensitivity to nucleotide inhibition is due to a combination of reduced apparent binding affinity in addition to reduced stabilisation of the closed state of the channel by nucleotides.

\section{Discussion}

Expression of W311*-GFP in the absence of SUR1, or in the presence of SUR1 truncated to the TMD0 or TMD0-L0 regions alone does not appear to affect nucleotide binding directly.
When current inhibition is measured, we see TMD0-232 decreases K\ATP{} senesitivity to nucleotide inhibition as seen in previous studies.
So why do mutations in L0 reduce sensitivity to nucleotide inhibition and cause neonatal diabetes?
Measuring binding directly allows us to address this problem.
We found that K205, a residue in L0, does in fact contribute to the nucleotide binding site.
This alone is not enough to explain the change in nucleotide inhibition.
Our novel finding is that mutating this residue alters the ability of TNP-ATP to close the channel.
This is consistent with the hypothesis that L0 plays a key role in tuning the modulatory function of nucleotides on Kir6.2.
The wild-type residue K205 is at least partly responsible for the strong coupling of nucleotide binding to channel inhibition.
But this does not explain why TMD0-L0 expression is not enough to restore full-length SUR1 like nucleotide inhibition.
Future experiments - residue E128 potentially plays a similar role for PIP2.
