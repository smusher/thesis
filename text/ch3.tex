\section{Designing a nucleotide binding assay}

\subsection{Criteria for a useful assay}

Previous approaches to measuring nucleotide binding directly have relied on isolating binding to individual classes of site by disrupting protein function; either by introducing mutations which abolish binding to a particular site or by measuring binding to Kir6.2 or SUR1 alone.
Traditionally, assays such as radioligand binding experiments require purifying the protein out of it's native membrane environment, thus rendering the channels nonfunctional.

To improve on these methods, an ideal assay measuring nucleotide binding to the K\ATP{} channel neeeds to fulfill a number of criteria.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item We need sufficient spatial sensitivity to distinguish between different classes of binding site; i.e. the assay should be capable of distingushing binding to Kir6.2 from binding to NBS1 or NBS2.
	\item We should be able to measure binding to a functional channel, for which we need to be able to measure binding in a membrane.
	\item There should be minimal perturbation of the channel in order for binding measurements to be physiologically relevant.
\end{enumerate}

TO fulfill these criteria, we used an approach involving a fluorescent unnatural amino acid, ANAP.
ANAP has been used increasing widely in the study of ion channel structure and function due to a few desirable qualities.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item It is smaller than traditional fluorescent labels such as fluorescent proteins or rhodamine derivatives.
	Therefore, it should be less perturbing to the function of the protein it labels.
	\item As it is an amino acid, it can be site-specifically inserted into any protein.
	This avoids the issues of other small chemical dyes which are targeted to a site via post-translational covalent modifications, typically by reacting with a cysteine residue.
	While this can be avoided in some proteins by mutating each cysteine residue to an alternative residue to avoid off-target labelling, there are functionally important cysteines in the K\ATP{} channel which cannot be mutated.
	\item ANAP is environmentally sensitive, which has been used to great effect in other studies.
	Notably, the peak emission ranges from \textasciitilde450nm to \textasciitilde490nm depending on the hydrophobicity of the surrounding environment.
\end{enumerate}

Initially, we hoped that the environmental sensitivity of ANAP fluorescence might be sufficient for the peak fluorescence of an ANAP residue inserted into an ATP binding site to measureably change when ATP was bound.
Unfortunately, when we introduced ANAP directly into the Kir6.2 binding site in place of residues I182 or F183 we were not able to observe any functional K\ATP{} channels at the cell membrane.

Instead, we turned to FRET as a reporter for ATP binding.
As ATP itself is not fluorescent, and has no intrinsic fluorescence quenching, we identified trinitrophenyl (TNP) -ATP as a fluorescent congener (Figure \ref{ch3fig:chemical_structures}).
TNP-ATP is most commonly used as an antogonist of P2X receptors, which are also sensitive to endogenous ATP.
TNP-ATP is an excellent FRET partner of ANAP, as evidenced by the good overlap in the TNP emission spectra and the ANAP extinction spectra (Figure \ref{ch3fig:spectral_overlap}).
This leads to a theoretical distance-dependency of FRET which is most sensitive between \SIrange{20}{60}{\angstrom} (Figure \ref{ch3fig:fret_efficiency}) with a calculated R0 of \SI{38.4}{\angstrom}.

\subsection{Choosing a site to incorporate ANAP}

THe theoretical R0 of \SI{38.4}{\angstrom} for FRET between ANAP and TNP-ATP allowed for flexibility when choosing a site to incorporate ANAP.
Ideally, a residue should be chosen to maximise the following aims:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The incorporated ANAP needs to be close enough to the nucleotide binding site of interest to report a quantifiable change in FRET when TNP-ATP is bound.
	This would not have to be close enough for \SI{100}{\percent} FRET to occur, but the greater the efficiency achieved the higher the signal-to-noise ratio would be for measuring binding.
	\item It also needs to be far enough from each other class of nucleotide binding site to avoid quenching by TNP-ATP bound to other sites.
	\item In addition to avoiding interference from other classes of binding site, we also need to avoid cross-talk between nucleotide binding sites of the same class on different subunits, as this would lead to difficulty interpreting the measured quenching.
	The ideal theoretical solution would be labelling only one nucleotide binding site per ion channel, but without using a concatemer this is not so easy in practise.
\end{enumerate}

To narrow down which residues could be candidates for ANAP incorporation to measure binding at Kir6.2, we took three cryo-EM structures of K\ATP{} with ATP bound and computationally docked TNP-ATP into the nucleotide binding pocket (Figure \ref{ch3fig:docking}).
To assess the validity of computationally docking a ligand to each structure, we first attempted to dock ATP to check that the highest-scoring binding poses were similar to those observed in the cryo-EM structures.
Docking ATP to both \#6C3P and \#6C3O yielded binding poses which were very similar to the pose found in the cryo-EM structures (Figures \ref{ch3fig:6c3p_docking}, \ref{ch3fig:6c3o_docking}).
However, docking ATP to \#6BAA resulted in binding poses which were in a flipped orientation relative to the pose found in the cryo-EM structure (Figure \ref{ch3fig:6baa_docking}).

We then took TNP-nucleotide structures from eleven different X-ray diffraction and cryo-EM structures published on RCSB to dock to the Kir6.2 binding site of K\ATP{}.
For both \#6BAA and \#6C3P we observed that the three highest scoring binding poses for TNP-nucleotides closely resemble those of the ATP solved in complex with the channel (Figures \ref{ch3fig:6baa_docking}, \ref{ch3fig:6c3p_docking}).
It is not so clear for \#6C3O, for which the highest scoring poses are not in agreement with each other or the solved structure of ATP.

Based on the predicted TNP-ATP poses for \#6BAA and \#6C3P, we could narrow down potential ANAP incorporation sites to within \SI{25}{\angstrom} of the centre of the TNP-moiety, at which distance we would expect to see over \SI{90}{\percent} FRET efficiency when TNP-ATP is bound to Kir6.2.
In addition, we excluded residues which fell within \SI{45}{\angstrom} of NBS1 or NBS2, as this restricts the potential FRET between TNP-ATP bound at these sites and our chosen residue to roughly \SI{25}{\percent} or less.
While we can exclude residues which fall too close to the NBS's of SUR1, the close proximity of the Kir6.2 nucleotide binding sites to each other means that we cannot exclude intersubunit FRET occuring; i.e. TNP-ATP binding to a neighbouring subunit will also be able to quench ANAP to a certain extent. However, this occurs in a predictable way that we can measure and account for.

We targeted two residues which fulfilled these criteria; F183 and W311.
In addition, they are both bulky hydrophobic residues similar to ANAP, and at which no mutations have been previously identified to alter K\ATP{} function.
To determine the extent to which crosstalk between neighbouring subunits would affect the measure FRET efficiency at these sites, we simulated the expected FRET for a single K\ATP{} channel bound to 0-4 molecules of TNP-ATP in an idealised scenario with no crosstalk, and compared the observed fluorescence quenching to a scenario including the possibility of crosstalk (Figure \ref{ch3fig:exifret_out}).
Due to the much shorter fluorescence lifetime of TNP-ATP compared to ANAP, we observe a deviation from the ideal scenario.
We can correct for this systematic deviation by transforming our observed ANAP quenching ($F/F_{max}$) into $log_2(\frac{F}{F_{max} + 1})$.

\section{Incorporating ANAP into the Kir6.2 binding site}

\subsection{Amber stop codon expression system}

ANAP can be introduced into a protein of interest by essentially expanding the genetic code to incorporate a noncanconical amino acid.
The amber stop codon (TAG) is the least frequently occuring stop codon in eukaryotic cells, and can be repurposed to encode ANAP.
An orthologous set of tRNA and its aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase are mutated and screened through directed evolution in order to charge the tRNA which recognises the amber stop codon with ANAP.
Thus, in cells expressing the ANAP charged tRNA, the amber stop codon introduced into the protein of interest is suppressed and ANAP is translated instead (Figure \ref{ch3fig:amber_codon}).

\subsection{ANAP incorporation into amber stop codon containing constructs}

\end{figure}

The nature of the amber stop codon suppression system requires a number of careful controls to ensure the following:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Stop codon recognition is not perfect, and there is a chance of read-through.
	Instead of incorporating ANAP, it is possible that the translation machinery can insert endogenous amino acids instead, leading to production of full length,unlabelled Kir6.2.
	However, we found that cells transfected with W311TAG constructs and pANAP which were not cultured in the presence of ANAP did not produce full length Kir6.2 (Figure \ref{ch3fig:western_1}, \ref{ch3fig:western_2}), suggesting there is minimal read-through of the stop codon in our experiments.
	\item Introducing a stop codon creates a risk that truncated Kir6.2 will be produced instead of ANAP labelled Kir6.2.
	This risk can be reduced by transfecting a dominant negative engineered version of eukaryotic translation termination factor 1(eRF1-E55D), which does not efficiently terminate protein synthesis in response to the amber stop codon (but leaves opal and ochre stop codons nearly unaffected) and thus increases the incorporation of ANAP.
	We found that transfection of W311TAG constructs with a C-terminal GFP tag produced minimal truncated Kir6.2 (less than \SI{10}{\percent} of the total density observed in Figure \ref{ch3fig:western_2}).
	\item Despite being the least frequent eukaryotic stop codon, the amber stop codon is still present in a significant number of proetin sequences.
	We must be careful that ANAP is not incorporated into a protein which localises to the plasma membrane to an extent which would affect our ability to assign ANAP fluorescence to Kir6.2.
	We found that in cells transfected with GFP-tagged Kir6.2 without an amber stop codon, there was no increase in ANAP fluorescence at the cell membrane (Figure \ref{ch3fig:wt_confocal}, \ref{ch3fig:wt_confocal_profiles}).
	By contrast, when W311TAG-GFP was transfected, we saw a clear increase in ANAP fluorescence at the cell membrane (Figure \ref{ch3fig:w311_confocal}, \ref{ch3fig:w311_confocal_profiles}), suggesting that any observed ANAP fluorescence at the cell membrane originates from our labelled Kir6.2 construct.

\section{Testing for functional membrane expression}

\subsection{Surface expression of HA-epitope labelled Kir6.2 constructs}

To assess the ability of ANAP-incorporating constructs to traffic to the plasma membrane, we used a luminence-based surface expression assay.
This assay relies on the recognition of an HA-epitope introduced into an extracellular region of the protein of interest (in this case, the N-terminal region of Kir6.2) by an anti-HA primary antibody followed by an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody.
The luminescence after applying HRP substrate is then proportional to the amount of protein at the plasma membrane of the cells.

We assessed the membrane expression of N-terminally HA-tagged Kir6.2 (nHA-Kir6.2) in the presence or absence of ANAP in the culture media and in the presence or absence of cotransfected SUR1.
We also measured how the addition of a C-terminal GFP tag affected membrane expression under these conditions.
We used untagged Kir6.2 as a control for nonspecific luminesence.

We find that for wild-type Kir6.2 (WT) there is roughly a 20-fold increase in observed luminescence when coexpressed with SUR1 over background, and roughly a 100-fold increase for the C-terminally GFP tagged Kir6.2 (WT-GFP, Figure \ref{ch3fig:surface_expression_1}, \ref{ch3fig:surface_expression_3}).
There is no difference in surface expression of these constructs when ANAP is present in the culture medium (Figure \ref{ch3fig:surface_expression_1}, \ref{ch3fig:surface_expression_4}).
When ANAP is incorporated at either residue 183 or 311 (F183* and W311* respectively) we see an increase in luminescence over background when coexpressed with SUR1 and with ANAP present in the culture medium (Figure \ref{ch3fig:surface_expression_1}, \ref{ch3fig:surface_expression_3}).
The presence of the C-terminal GFP tag increases luminescence further for both constructs, dramatically so for W311*.
However, when F183* is transfected and ANAP is not present in the culture media we still see a similar increase in fluorescence over background when compared to the luminescence when ANAP is present (Figure \ref{ch3fig:surface_expression_1}, \ref{ch3fig:surface_expression_4}), suggesting that a large proportion of the protein reaching the membrane does not have ANAP incorporated.
In contrast, when W311*-GFP is transfected with SUR1 in the presence of ANAP, we see a 10-fold increase in luminescence compared to when ANAP is not present, consitent with the majority of surface expressed protein incorporating ANAP.
We also see a consistent increase in luminescence for all constructs aside from W311* due to cotransfection with SUR1 (Figure \ref{ch3fig:surface_expression_2}), suggesting that the incorporation of ANAP and the addition of a C-terminal GFP tag do not affect the role of SUR1 in froming the full K\ATP{} complex and trafficking to the membrane.

\subsection{Electrophysiology of Kir6.2 constructs}

To establish whether W311*-GFP formed K\ATP{} channels with similar function to wild-type, we excised patches from cells transfected with either WT-GFP or W311*-GFP cotransfected with SUR1.
Excision was performed in Mg\textsuperscript{2+}-free solution to reduce rundown and to prevent activation of the channel by nucleotides.
We observed similar magnitudes of current for both WT-GFP and W311*-GFP, and currents ran own at similar rates.

We fit our full dataset with equation \ref{eq:hill} (Figure \ref{ch3fig:atp_inhibition_1}), and used the estimated $h$ and $I_{max}$ parameters to fit each individual experiment and determine an $IC_{50}$ value (plotted as points in Figure \ref{ch3fig:atp_inhibition_2}).
The $IC_{50}$ values were fit with a random effects model with values grouped by construct and nucleotide.
The posterior probability distributions of this model are also shown in Figure \ref{ch3fig:atp_inhibition_2}.
These distributions reflect the variability of the observed data, not our uncertainty of the underlying $IC_{50}$ value; i.e. we would expect \SI{95}{\percent} of all future observations for a given construct and nucleotide to fall within the \SI{95}{\percent} intervals of the distributions.
For all $IC_50$ and $EC_{50}$ values fitted this way, in the text we will report the \SI{95}{\percent} confidence intervals of the parameter estimate, which reflects only our uncertainty of the true value and not experimental variability.

Perfusion of ATP resulted in current inhibition with an IC\textsubscript{50} of \SIrange{25}{45}{\micro\Molar} for WT-GFP and \SIrange{77}{130}{\micro\Molar} for W311*-GFP.
Thus, despite the distance from the ATP binding site, the W311 mutation clearly affects some aspect of nucleotide inhibition.
However, we assume that insights into the function of the ANAP-incorporating channel will still be applicable to wild-type channels despite the change in nucleotide inhibition.

Next, we established that TNP-ATP inhibits K\ATP{} to a similar extent as ATP (Figure \ref{ch3fig:tnpatp_inhibition_1}, \ref{ch3fig:tnpatp_inhibition_2}).
We observed current inhibition with an IC\textsubscript{50} of \SIrange{0.7}{1.8}{\micro\Molar} for WT-GFP and \SIrange{3.5}{10}{\micro\Molar} for W311*-GFP.
K\ATP{} thus appears to be more sensitive to inhibition by TNP-ATP than by ATP.
This could potentially be due to extra contacts made by the TNP moiety with Kir6.2, seen in our computational docking (Figure \ref{ch3fig:docking}).

\subsection{Unroofed membrane binding assay of Kir6.2 constructs}

We then directly measured nucleotide binding to W311*-GFP in unroofed membranes.
Briefly sonicating transfected cells adhered to coverslips results in the lower membrane of the cell remaining stuck to the coverslip while the rest of the cell contents is disrupted and perfused away.
This leaves the cytoplasmic domains of expressed K\ATP{} channels open to perfusion of TNP-ATP.
These patches of membrane are barely visible under brightfield illumination, but due to the presence of the C-terminal GFP tag and the incorporated ANAP, we can see patches of membrane expressing K\ATP{} channels light up when we excite either fluorophore (Figure \ref{ch3fig:unroofed_images}).
By measuring the fluorescence spectra of patches of unroofed membrane, we can separate the fluorescence emission peaks of the C-terminal GFP tag and the incorporated ANAP (Figure \ref{ch3fig:unroofed_spectral_images}).
The peak at \SI{472}{\nano\metre} corresponds to ANAP emission, while the peak at \SI{508}{\nano\metre} corresponds to GFP emission.
We observed no change in the locations of those peaks in the presence of ATP or TNP-ATP.

Perfusing TNP-ATP results in a decrease in the peak corresponding to ANAP fluorescence, and a concomittant increase in a fluorescence peak which corresponds to the TNP-ATP (Figure \ref{ch3fig:unroofed_spectral_traces}).
This phenomenon is the fresult of FRET between TNP-ATP bound to the channel at the Kir6.2 binding site.
The decrease in ANAP fluorescence is almost directly correlated to an increase in bound nucleotide.
We can plot the quenching of ANAP fluorescence as a concentration-response curve as in Figure \ref{ch3fig:unroofed_intensities}.

Before analysis, ANAP bleaching was corrected as shown in Figure \ref{ch3fig:bleaching_plots_2}.
ANAP intensities of spectra imaged during bath perfusion in between applications of TNP-ATP were fit with Equation \ref{eq:bleaching}.
We found that all unroofed experiments showed bleaching well described by the single exponential fit to equation \ref{eq:bleaching}.
In each experiment, there was a reasonable proportion of ANAP fluorescence remaining by the last exposure (FIgure \ref{ch3fig:bleaching_terms_4}), maintaining a good signal-to-noise ratio for each spectra imaged.

\end{figure}

To equivocate ANAP quenching and nucleotide binding, first we need to adjust for the FRET between adjacent subunits of Kir6.2.
The difference between the ideal 1:1 subunit/ligand FRET efficiency and the simulated experimental FRET efficiency resulted in a correction factor of $log_2(\frac{F}{F_{max}} + 1)$.

Secondly, we need to correct for incomplete FRET due to the distance between the donor and acceptor.
Based on the computational docking, we predicted a maximal FRET efficiency of \SI{91}{\percent} when every Kir6.2 subunit is bound by TNP-ATP.
Fitting our adjusted data to a Hill equation results in a maximum observed FRET efficiency of \SI{90}{\percent}, agreeing well with our prediction.
We can then normalise our observed fluorescence data by this value.

Overall, these two corrections do not dramatically alter our results (Figure \ref{ch3fig:tnpatp_quenching_1}), and we performed our analysis on both corrected and uncorrected results to ensure that there was no potential difference in interpration which derived from treating our data in this way.

We observed quenching of ANAP fluorescence over a concentration range of TNP-ATP similar to the range in which we observed inhibition of current in W311*-GFP (Figure \ref{ch3fig:ec50_fits_3}, \ref{ch3fig:tnpatp_quenching_2}).
When fit to a Hill equation, quenching was fit with an EC\textsubscript{50} of \SIrange{21}{31}{\micro\Molar}, while the corrected binding data gave an EC\textsubscript{50} of \SIrange{30}{46}{\micro\Molar}.
Notably, this EC\textsubscript{50} is somewhat right-shifted compared to the IC\textsubscript{50} we observed in excised patches (\SIrange{3.5}{10}{\micro\Molar}).

\subsection{Patch-clamp fluorometry of Kir6.2 constructs}

To ensure that the ANAP fluorescence we observe in the unroofed membranes is emitted by functional channels, and thus the quenching by TNP-ATP reflects nucleotide binding to the same population of channels we are measuring inhibition from, we measured fluorescence quenching and current inhibition from the same excised patches (Figure \ref{ch3fig:atp_tnpatp_trace}, \ref{ch3fig:atp_tnpatp_spectra_1}, \ref{ch3fig:atp_tnpatp_spectra_2}).

This experimental paradigm leads to two complications compared to performing the measurements separately.
Firstly, the number of channels in an excised patch are far smaller than the number of channels in an unroofed membrane patch.
This results in a much dimmer fluorescence readout, and a lower signal-to-noise ratio.
Secondly, the presence of the pipette glass in the images results in some abnormalities in the background subtraction procedure.
This is not due to the glass itself, but results from the occlusion of TNP-ATP from the image surrounding the patch.
This leads to oversubtraction of the background TNP-ATP spectra, leading to an apparent negative peak in our corrected images.
However, we find that there is no overlap of this peak and the ANAP peak, so our fluorescence quenching measurements are unaffected by this phenomenon.
We were able to correct for ANAP bleaching in the same manner as we did for unroofed membranes (Figure \ref{ch3fig:pcf_bleaching}).

Our fluoresence measurements from excised patches agree reasonably well (albeit slightly right-shifted) with our measurements for unroofed membranes (Figure \ref{ch3fig:pcf_1}), with an $EC_{50}$ value of \SIrange{77}{140}{\micro\Molar}.
Our finding that the EC\textsubscript{50} for TNP-ATP binding is right-shifted compared to the IC\textsubscript{50} for TNP-ATP inhibition is consistent between each experimental paradigm (Figure \ref{ch3fig:ec50_fits_3}, \ref{ch3fig:ec50_fits_4}).
This finding has implications for how exactly the binding of nucleotides to Kir6.2 leads to closure of the K\ATP{} channel pore.
