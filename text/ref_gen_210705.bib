	abstract = {The response of {ATP}-sensitive K+ channels ({KATP}) to cellular metabolism is coordinated by three classes of nucleotide binding site ({NBS}). We used a novel approach involving labeling of intact channels in a native, membrane environment with a non-canonical fluorescent amino acid and measurement (using {FRET} with fluorescent nucleotides) of steady-state and time-resolved nucleotide binding to dissect the role of {NBS}2 of the accessory {SUR}1 subunit of {KATP} in channel gating. Binding to {NBS}2 was Mg2+-independent, but Mg2+ was required to trigger a conformational change in {SUR}1. Mutation of a lysine (K1384A) in {NBS}2 that coordinates bound nucleotides increased the {EC}50 for trinitrophenyl-{ADP} binding to {NBS}2, but only in the presence of Mg2+, indicating that this mutation disrupts the ligand-induced conformational change. Comparison of nucleotide-binding with ionic currents suggests a model in which each nucleotide binding event to {NBS}2 of {SUR}1 is independent and promotes {KATP} activation by the same amount.},

	abstract = {The {ATP}-sensitive potassium channel ({KATP} channel) couples blood levels of glucose to insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells. {KATP} channel closure triggers a cascade of events that results in insulin release. Metabolically generated changes in the intracellular concentrations of adenosine nucleotides are integral to this regulation, with {ATP} and {ADP} closing the channel and {MgATP} and {MgADP} increasing channel activity. Activating mutations in the genes encoding either of the two types of {KATP} channel subunit (Kir6.2 and {SUR}1) result in neonatal diabetes mellitus, whereas loss-of-function mutations cause hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia of infancy. Sulfonylurea and glinide drugs, which bind to {SUR}1, close the channel through a pathway independent of {ATP} and are now the primary therapy for neonatal diabetes mellitus caused by mutations in the genes encoding {KATP} channel subunits. Insight into the molecular details of drug and nucleotide regulation of channel activity has been illuminated by cryo-electron microscopy structures that reveal the atomic-level organization of the {KATP} channel complex. Here we review how these structures aid our understanding of how the various mutations in the genes encoding Kir6.2 ({KCNJ}11) and {SUR}1 ({ABCC}8) lead to a reduction in {ATP} inhibition and thereby neonatal diabetes mellitus. We also provide an update on known mutations and sulfonylurea therapy in neonatal diabetes mellitus.},

	abstract = {The structure and dynamics of proteins underlies the workings of virtually every biological process. Existing biophysical methods are inadequate to measure protein structure at atomic resolution, on a rapid time scale, with limited amounts of protein, and in the context of a cell or membrane. {FRET} can measure distances between two probes, but depends on the orientation of the probes and typically works only over long distances comparable with the size of many proteins. Also, common probes used for {FRET} can be large and have long, flexible attachment linkers that position dyes far from the protein backbone. Here, we improve and extend a fluorescence method called transition metal ion {FRET} that uses energy transfer to transition metal ions as a reporter of short-range distances in proteins with little orientation dependence. This method uses a very small cysteine-reactive dye monobromobimane, with virtually no linker, and various transition metal ions bound close to the peptide backbone as the acceptor. We show that, unlike larger fluorophores and longer linkers, this donor–acceptor pair accurately reports short-range distances and changes in backbone distances. We further extend the method by using cysteine-reactive metal chelators, which allow the technique to be used in protein regions of unknown secondary structure or when native metal ion binding sites are present. This improved method overcomes several of the key limitations of classical {FRET} for intramolecular distance measurements.},

	abstract = {Adenosine triphosphate ({ATP})–sensitive K+ ({KATP}) channels are molecular sensors of cell metabolism. These hetero-octameric channels, comprising four inward rectifier K+ channel subunits (Kir6.1 or Kir6.2) and four sulfonylurea receptor ({SUR}1 or {SUR}2A/B) subunits, detect metabolic changes via three classes of intracellular adenine nucleotide ({ATP}/{ADP}) binding site. One site, located on the Kir subunit, causes inhibition of the channel when {ATP} or {ADP} is bound. The other two sites, located on the {SUR} subunit, excite the channel when bound to Mg nucleotides. In pancreatic beta cells, an increase in extracellular glucose causes a change in oxidative metabolism and thus turnover of adenine nucleotides in the cytoplasm. This leads to the closure of {KATP} channels, which depolarizes the plasma membrane and permits Ca2+ influx and insulin secretion. Many of the molecular details regarding the assembly of the {KATP} complex, and how changes in nucleotide concentrations affect gating, have recently been uncovered by several single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structures of the pancreatic {KATP} channel (Kir6.2/{SUR}1) at near-atomic resolution. Here, the author discusses the detailed picture of excitatory and inhibitory ligand binding to {KATP} that these structures present and suggests a possible mechanism by which channel activation may proceed from the ligand-binding domains of {SUR} to the channel pore.},

Here, we review the regulation of the {KATP} channel by adenine nucleotides and present an equilibrium allosteric model for nucleotide activation and inhibition.

	shorttitle = {Running out of time},
	abstract = {{KATP} channels act as key regulators of electrical excitability by coupling metabolic cues—mainly intracellular adenine nucleotide concentrations—to cellular potassium ion efflux. However, their study has been hindered by their rapid loss of activity in excised membrane patches (rundown), and by a second phenomenon, the decline of activation by Mg-nucleotides ({DAMN}). Degradation of {PI}(4,5)P2 and other phosphoinositides is the strongest candidate for the molecular cause of rundown. Broad evidence indicates that most other determinants of rundown (e.g. phosphorylation, intracellular calcium, channel mutations that affect rundown) also act by influencing {KATP} channel regulation by phosphoinositides. Unfortunately, experimental conditions that reproducibly prevent rundown have remained elusive, necessitating post hoc data compensation. Rundown is clearly distinct from {DAMN}. While the former is associated with pore-forming Kir6.2 subunits, {DAMN} is generally a slower process involving the regulatory sulfonylurea receptor ({SUR}) subunits. We speculate that it arises when {SUR} subunits enter non-physiological conformational states associated with the loss of {SUR} nucleotide-binding domain dimerization following prolonged exposure to nucleotide-free conditions. This review presents new information on both rundown and {DAMN}, summarizes our current understanding of these processes and considers their physiological roles.This article is part of the themed issue ‘Evolution brings Ca2+ and {ATP} together to control life and death’.},

Mg-nucleotide binding to {SUR}1 stimulates {KATP}. In the absence of Mg2+, {SUR}1 increases the apparent affinity for nucleotide inhibition at Kir6.2 by an unknown mechanism. We simultaneously measured channel currents and nucleotide binding to Kir6.2. Fits to combined data sets suggest that {KATP} closes with only one nucleotide molecule bound. A Kir6.2 mutation (C166S) that increases channel activity did not affect nucleotide binding, but greatly perturbed the ability of bound nucleotide to inhibit {KATP}. Mutations at position K205 in {SUR}1 affected both nucleotide affinity and the ability of bound nucleotide to inhibit {KATP}. This suggests a dual role for {SUR}1 in {KATP} inhibition, both in directly contributing to nucleotide binding and in stabilising the nucleotide-bound closed state.},

Despite this popularity, or perhaps because of it, most psychologists are not aware of the statistical peculiarities of thep value procedure. In particular,p values are based on data that were never observed, and these hypothetical data are themselves influenced by subjective intentions. Moreover,p values do not quantify statistical evidence. This article reviews thesep value problems and illustrates each problem with concrete examples. The three problems are familiar to statisticians but may be new to psychologists. A practical solution to thesep value problems is to adopt a model selection perspective and use the Bayesian information criterion ({BIC}) for statistical inference (Raftery, 1995). The {BIC} provides an approximation to a Bayesian hypothesis test, does not require the specification of priors, and can be easily calculated from {SPSS} output.},

	abstract = {1 {ATP}-sensitive potassium ({KATP}) channels are composed of pore-forming (Kir6.x) and regulatory sulphonylurea receptor ({SURx}) subunits. We have isolated a novel {SUR} variant ({SUR}1bΔ33) from a hypothalamic {cDNA} library. This variant lacked exon 33 and introduced a frameshift that produced a truncated protein lacking the second nucleotide binding domain ({NBD}2). It was expressed at low levels in hypothalamus, midbrain, heart and the insulin-secreting beta-cell line {MIN}6. 2 We examined the properties of {KATP} channels composed of Kir6.2 and {SUR}1bΔ33 by recording macroscopic currents in membrane patches excised from Xenopus oocytes expressing these subunits. We also investigated the effect of truncating {SUR}1 at either the start ({SUR}1bT1) or end ({SUR}1bT2) of exon 33 on {KATP} channel properties. 3 Kir6.2/{SUR}1bΔ33 showed an enhanced open probability (Po= 0.6 at -60 {mV}) and a reduced {ATP} sensitivity (Ki, 86 μm), when compared with wild-type channels (Po= 0.3; Ki, 22 μm). However, Kir6.2/{SUR}1bT1 and Kir6.2/{SUR}1bT2 resembled the wild-type channel in their Po and {ATP} sensitivity. 4 Neither {MgADP}, nor the K+ channel opener diazoxide, enhanced Kir6.2/{SUR}1bΔ33, Kir6.2/{SUR}1bT1 or Kir6.2/{SUR}1bT2 currents, consistent with the idea that these agents require an intact {NBD}2 for their action. Sulphonylureas blocked {KATP} channels containing any of the three {SUR} variants, but in excised patches the extent of block was less than that for the wild-type channel. In intact cells, the extent of sulphonylurea block of Kir6.2/{SUR}1bΔ33 was greater than that in excised patches and was comparable to that found for wild-type channels. 5 Our results demonstrate that {NBD}2 is not essential for functional expression or sulphonylurea block, but is required for {KATP} channel activation by K+ channel openers and nucleotides. Some of the unusual properties of Kir6.2/{SUR}1bΔ33 resemble those reported for the {KATP} channel of ventromedial hypothalamic ({VMH}) neurones, but the fact that this {mRNA} is expressed at low levels in many other tissues makes it less likely that {SUR}1bΔ33 serves as the {SUR} subunit for the {VMH} {KATP} channel.},

To distinguish the {ATP} binding properties of the two nucleotide-binding folds ({NBFs}) of {SUR}1, we prepared antibodies against {NBF}1 and {NBF}2, and the tryptic fragment of {SUR}1 was immunoprecipitated after photoaffinity labeling with 8-azido-[$^{\textrm{32}}$P]{ATP}.

These results indicate that {NBF}1 of {SUR}1 binds 8-azido-{ATP} strongly in a magnesium-independent manner and that {NBF}2 binds 8-azido-{ATP} weakly in a magnesium-dependent manner. Furthermore, the 65-{kDa} tryptic fragment was not photoaffinity-labeled with 8-azido-[γ-$^{\textrm{32}}$P]{ATP} at 37 °C, whereas the 35-{kDa} tryptic fragment was, suggesting that {NBF}2 of {SUR}1 may have {ATPase} activity and that {NBF}1 has none or little.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The mechanism of {ATP}-sensitive potassium ({KATP}) channel closure by {ATP} is unclear, and various kinetic models in which {ATP} binds to open or to closed states have previously been presented. Effects of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate ({PIP}2) and multiple Kir6.2 mutations on {ATP} inhibition and open probability in the absence of {ATP} are explainable in kinetic models where {ATP} stabilizes a closed state and interaction with an open state is not required. Evidence that {ATP} can in fact interact with the open state of the channel is presented here. The mutant Kir6.2[L164C] is very sensitive to Cd2+ block, but very insensitive to {ATP}, with no significant inhibition in 1mM {ATP}. However, 1mM {ATP} fully protects the channel from Cd2+ block. Allosteric kinetic models in which the channel can be in either open or closed states with or without {ATP} bound are considered. Such models predict a pedestal in the {ATP} inhibition, i.e., a maximal amount of inhibition at saturating {ATP} concentrations. This pedestal is predicted to occur at {\textgreater}50mM {ATP} in the L164C mutant, but at {\textgreater}1mM in the double mutant L164C/R176A. As predicted, {ATP} inhibits Kir6.2[L164C/R176A] to a maximum of ∼40\%, with a clear plateau beyond 2mM. These results indicate that {ATP} acts as an allosteric ligand, interacting with both open and closed states of the channel.},

These channels are heteromultimers composed with a 4:4 stoichiometry of an inwardly rectifying K+ channel subunit (Kir6.2) plus a regulatory sulfonylurea receptor. To elucidate stoichiometry of {ATP}(4-) action, we analyzed {ATP}(4-) sensitivity of channels coassembled from wild-type Kir6.2 and a loss of {ATP}(4-) sensitivity mutant (G334D). Concentration-inhibition curves for {cDNA} ratios of 1:1 or 1:10 resembled those for channel block resulting from interaction with 1 of 4 sites, whereas models for inhibition requiring occupation of 2, 3, or 4 sites were incongruous. Random assembly of wild-type Kir6.2 with the G334D mutant was confirmed by controls, which assessed the effect of an additional mutation that induced strong rectification (N160D). We conclude 4 identical noncooperative {ATP}(4-) sites to be grouped within 1 {KATP} channel complex, with occupation of 1 site being sufficient to induce channel closure. This architecture might facilitate coupling of [{ATP}(4-)] to insulin secretion and may protect against diabetic dysregulation resulting from heterozygous mutations in Kir6.2.},

	abstract = {The {ATP}-sensitive potassium ({KATP}) channels in pancreatic beta cells are critical in the regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion. Although electrophysiological studies provide clues to the complex control of {KATP} channels by {ATP}, {MgADP}, and pharmacological agents, the molecular mechanism of {KATP}-channel regulation remains unclear. The {KATP} channel is a heterooligomeric complex of {SUR}1 subunits of the {ATP}-binding-cassette superfamily with two nucleotide-binding folds ({NBF}1 and {NBF}2) and the pore-forming Kir6.2 subunits. Here, we report that {MgATP} and {MgADP}, but not the Mg salt of γ-thio-{ATP}, stabilize the binding of prebound 8-azido-[α-32P]{ATP} to {SUR}1. Mutation in the Walker A and B motifs of {NBF}2 of {SUR}1 abolished this stabilizing effect of {MgADP}. These results suggest that {SUR}1 binds 8-azido-{ATP} strongly at {NBF}1 and that {MgADP}, either by direct binding to {NBF}2 or by hydrolysis of bound {MgATP} at {NBF}2, stabilizes prebound 8-azido-{ATP} binding at {NBF}1. The sulfonylurea glibenclamide caused release of prebound 8-azido-[α-32P]{ATP} from {SUR}1 in the presence of {MgADP} or {MgATP} in a concentration-dependent manner. This direct biochemical evidence of cooperative interaction in nucleotide binding of the two {NBFs} of {SUR}1 suggests that glibenclamide both blocks this cooperative binding of {ATP} and {MgADP} and, in cooperation with the {MgADP} bound at {NBF}2, causes {ATP} to be released from {NBF}1.},

This method exploits the fact that the probability of the energy transfer is related to the separation between the fluorescent molecules. This relationship is well described for a single pair of fluorophores but is complicated in systems containing more than two fluorophores. Here, we present a Monte Carlo calculation scheme that has been implemented through a user-friendly web-based program called {ExiFRET} that can be used to determine the {FRET} efficiency in a wide range of fluorophore arrangements. {ExiFRET} is useful to model {FRET} for individual fluorophores randomly distributed in two or three dimensions, fluorophores linked in pairs or arranged in regular geometries with or without predefined stoichiometries. {ExiFRET} can model both uniform distributions and fluorophores that are aggregated in clusters. We demonstrate how this tool can be employed to understand the effect of labeling efficiency on {FRET} efficiency, estimate relative contributions of inter- and intramolecular {FRET}, investigate the structure of multimeric proteins, stoichiometries, and oligomers, and to aid experiments studying the aggregation of lipids and proteins in membrane environments. We also present an extension that can be used to study instances in which fluorophores have constrained orientations.},

Binding of this analogue substrate to the enzyme is characterized by a 9-fold enhancement in probe fluorescence. Saturating levels of the feedback inhibitor, threonine, produce a 77\% increase in fluorescence enhancement, indicating an increase in the rigidity or hydrophobicity of the nucleotide-binding site in the inhibited form of the enzyme. Threonine titration studies indicate that the two inhibitor-binding sites found on each subunit do not contribute equally to the fluorescence-detected conformational change. Comparison of the spectral change with the inhibition of dehydrogenase activity has revealed the exclusive involvement of the non-kinase threonine sites. No transition can be detected as a consequence of inhibitor binding at the kinase subsites. The results of the 2'(3')-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5'-triphosphate study have provided further evidence for a concerted kinase-dehydrogenase conformational change which is induced by threonine interaction with the high affinity binding sites and which provides maximal inhibition of homoserine dehydrogenase and the majority of aspartokinase inhibition. The failure to observe a distinct enzyme form produced by threonine occupation of the low affinity kinase sites suggests that no large structural reorganization of the kinase active site is produced as a result of this binding event. The conformational change, suggested by the cooperativity of threonine binding, must instead involve only a subtle or highly localized alteration which does not perturb the environment of the {ATP}-binding cleft.},

Nevertheless, one can increase the probability of successful crystallization by precrystallization screening, a process by which one analyzes the monodispersity and stability of the protein-detergent complex. Traditionally, this has required microgram to milligram quantities of purified protein and a concomitant investment of time and resources. Here, we describe a rapid and efficient precrystallization screening strategy in which the target protein is covalently fused to green fluorescent protein ({GFP}) and the resulting unpurified protein is analyzed by fluorescence-detection size-exclusion chromatography ({FSEC}). This strategy requires only nanogram quantities of unpurified protein and allows one to evaluate localization and expression level, the degree of monodispersity, and the approximate molecular mass. We show the application of this precrystallization screening to four membrane proteins derived from prokaryotic or eukaryotic organisms.},

Fluorescence signals were reliably observed when fluorophore was covalently attached to a site between the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain and the pore. While iodide, an anionic quencher, has a higher quenching efficiency in the channel's closed state, thallium ion, a cationic quencher, has a higher quenching efficiency in the open state.

The absence of {ATP} evoked a large additional K+ conductance. In cell-attached patches single K+-channels were observed in the absence of glucose. Adition of glucose (20 {mM}) to the bath suppressed the channel activity and initiated action potentials. Similar single-channel currents were recorded from isolated patches. In this case the channels were reversibly blocked by adding {ATP} (3 {mM}) to the solution at the intracellular side of the membrane. The conductances (51 {pS} and 56 {pS} for [K+]0=145 {mM}, T=21° C) and kinetics (at −70 {mV}: τopen=2.2 ms and τclosed=0.38 ms and 0.33 ms) of the glucose- and {ATP}-dependent channels were found to be very similar.

It is well established that glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is associated with the appearance of electrical activity in the beta-cell1,2; glucose concentrations above the threshold level for insulin release produce a slow membrane depolarization followed by either oscillatory bursts of action potentials (5–15 {mM} glucose) or continuous spiking ({\textgreater}16mM glucose). Tracer flux studies3 and microelectrode measurements using intact islets of Langerhans4 have indicated that the initial depolarization induced by glucose is caused by a decrease in the resting membrane permeability to potassium. Evidence also suggests that the electrical5, ionic6 and secretory responses7,8 to glucose are mediated by the metabolism of the sugar within the beta-cell. By using cell-attached membrane patches9 from isolated rat pancreatic beta-cells, we have now identified a potassium channel (G-channel) that is active at the resting potential and is inhibited by glucose. Closure of this channel requires glucose metabolism. This is the first report of a potassium channel whose activity is modulated by glucose, and which may couple metabolic and ionic events involved in the secretion of insulin.},

All tagged constructs generated functional channels with essentially normal properties when coexpressed with the relevant other subunit. {GFP}-tagged Kir6.2 (Kir6.2-{GFP}) showed perinuclear and plasma membrane fluorescence patterns when expressed alone or with {SUR}1, and a very similar pattern was observed when channel-forming {SUR}1-Kir6.2-{GFP} was expressed on its own.

Choline potentiates the depolarizing effect of acetylcholine (Ach) when applied in normal Ringer. Decamethonium has a ‘diphasic’ action, initial depression of the Ach effect being followed by more prolonged potentiation. When these experiments are made after treating the muscle with an esterase inhibitor (prostigmine 10-6 w/v), the potentiation of the Ach effect, by decamethonium or choline, is absent and replaced by simple ‘curare-like’ inhibition. When decamethonium is allowed to interact with a rapidly acting stable ester (carbaminoylcholine or succinylcholine), it produces simple 'curare-like’ inhibition. The triple effects of choline and decamethonium, i. e. (i) weak depolarization, (ii) potentiation of Ach in normal Ringer solution, (iii) inhibition of Ach in the presence of prostigmine, can be explained by competitive reactions between the drugs and receptor as well as Ach-esterase molecules. It is suggested that the first step in a depolarizing end-plate reaction is the formation of an intermediate, inactive, compound between drug and receptor.},

	abstract = {1 {ATP}-sensitive potassium ({KATP}) channels are composed of pore-forming Kir6.2 and regulatory {SUR} subunits. {ATP} inhibits the channel by interacting with Kir6.2, while sulphonylureas block channel activity by interaction with a high-affinity site on {SUR}1 and a low-affinity site on Kir6.2. {MgADP} and diazoxide interact with {SUR}1 to promote channel activity. 2 We examined the effect of N-terminal deletions of Kir6.2 on the channel open probability, {ATP} sensitivity and sulphonylurea sensitivity by recording macroscopic currents in membrane patches excised from Xenopus oocytes expressing wild-type or mutant Kir6.2/{SUR}1. 3 A 14 amino acid N-terminal deletion (ΔN14) did not affect the gating, {ATP} sensitivity or tolbutamide block of a truncated isoform of Kir6.2, Kir6.2{ΔC}26, expressed in the absence of {SUR}1. Thus, the N-terminal deletion does not alter the intrinsic properties of Kir6.2. 4 When Kir6.2{ΔN}14 was coexpressed with {SUR}1, the resulting {KATP} channels had a higher open probability (Po= 0·7) and a lower {ATP} sensitivity (Ki= 196 μM) than wild-type (Kir6.2/{SUR}1) channels (Po= 0·32, Ki= 28 μM). High-affinity tolbutamide block was also abolished. 5 Truncation of five or nine amino acids from the N-terminus of Kir6.2 also enhanced the open probability, and reduced both the {ATP} sensitivity and the fraction of high-affinity tolbutamide block, although to a lesser extent than for the ΔN14 deletion. Site-directed mutagenesis suggests that hydrophobic residues in Kir6.2 may be involved in this effect. 6 The reduced {ATP} sensitivity of Kir6.2{ΔN}14 may be explained by the increased Po. However, when the Po was decreased (by {ATP}), tolbutamide was unable to block Kir6.2{ΔN}14/{SUR}1-K719A,K1385M currents, despite the fact that the drug inhibited Kir6.2-C166S/{SUR}1-K719A,K1385M currents (which in the absence of {ATP} have a Po of {\textgreater} 0·8 and are not blocked by tolbutamide). Thus the N-terminus of Kir6.2 may be involved in coupling sulphonylurea binding to {SUR}1 to closure of the Kir6.2 pore.},

This inhibition plays a crucial role in the coupling of electrical activity to energy metabolism in a variety of cells. The {KATP} channel is formed from four each of a sulfonylurea receptor ({SUR}) regulatory subunit and an inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir6.2) pore-forming subunit. We used systematic chimeric and point mutagenesis, combined with patch-clamp recording, to investigate the molecular basis of {ATP}-dependent inhibition gating of mouse pancreatic beta cell {KATP} channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. We identified distinct functional domains of the presumed cytoplasmic C-terminal segment of the Kir6.2 subunit that play an important role in this inhibition. Our results suggest that one domain is associated with inhibitory {ATP} binding and another with gate closure.},

We suggest that these {MRP}-related proteins are also characterized by a special, common membrane topology pattern. The most studied {ABC} transporters, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ({CFTR}) and the multidrug resistance ({MDR}) proteins, were shown to contain a tandem repeat of six transmembrane helices, each set followed by an {ATP}-binding domain. According to the present study, in contrast to various membrane topology predictions proposed for the different {MRP}-related proteins, they all seem to have a {CFTR}/{MDR}-like core structure, and an additional, large, N-terminal hydrophobic region. This latter domain is predicted to contain 4–6 (most probably 5) transmembrane helices, and is occasionally glycosylated on the cell surface. Since all the {MRP}-related transporters were shown to interact with anionic compounds, the N-terminal membrane-bound domain may have a key role in these interactions.},

Binding of {MgATP} at the {SUR} nucleotide binding domains ({NBDs}) results in {NBD} dimerization, and hydrolysis of {MgATP} at the {NBDs} leads to channel opening. The {SUR} proteins also mediate interactions with {KATP} channel openers ({KCOs}) that activate the channel, with {KCO} binding and/or activation involving residues in the transmembrane helices and cytoplasmic loops of the {SUR} proteins. Because the cytoplasmic loops make extensive interactions with the {NBDs}, we hypothesized that the {NBDs} may also be involved in {KCO} binding. Here, we report nuclear magnetic resonance ({NMR}) spectroscopy studies that demonstrate a specific interaction of the {KCO} pinacidil with the first nucleotide binding domain ({NBD}1) from {SUR}2A, the regulatory {SUR} protein in cardiac {KATP} channels. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence titrations also demonstrate binding of pinacidil to {SUR}2A {NBD}1, and fluorescent nucleotide binding studies show that pinacidil binding increases the affinity of {SUR}2A {NBD}1 for {ATP}. In contrast, the {KCO} diazoxide does not interact with {SUR}2A {NBD}1 under the same conditions. {NMR} relaxation experiments and size exclusion chromatography indicate that {SUR}2A {NBD}1 is monomeric under the conditions used in drug binding studies. These studies identify additional binding sites for commonly used {KCOs} and provide a foundation for testing binding of drugs to the {SUR} {NBDs}.},

	abstract = {The {OpuA} system of Bacillus subtilis is a member of the substrate-binding-protein-dependent {ABC} transporter superfamily and serves for the uptake of the compatible solute glycine betaine under hyperosmotic growth conditions. Here, we have characterized the nucleotide-binding protein ({OpuAA}) of the B.subtilis {OpuA} transporter in vitro. {OpuAA} was overexpressed heterologously in Escherichia coli as a hexahistidine tag fusion protein and purified to homogeneity by affinity and size exclusion chromatography ({SEC}). Dynamic monomer/dimer equilibrium was observed for {OpuAA}, and the {KD} value was determined to be 6 μM. Under high ionic strength assay conditions, the monomer/dimer interconversion was diminished, which enabled separation of both species by {SEC} and separate analysis of both monomeric and dimeric {OpuAA}. In the presence of 1 M {NaCl}, monomeric {OpuAA} showed a basal {ATPase} activity ({KM}=0.45 {mM}; k2=2.3 min−1), whereas dimeric {OpuAA} showed little {ATPase} activity under this condition. The addition of nucleotides influenced the monomer/dimer ratio of {OpuAA}, demonstrating different oligomeric states during its catalytic cycle. The monomer was the preferred species under post-hydrolysis conditions (e.g. {ADP}/Mg2+), whereas the dimer dominated the nucleotide-free and {ATP}-bound states. The affinity and stoichiometry of monomeric or dimeric {OpuAA}/{ATP} complexes were determined by means of the fluorescent {ATP}-analog {TNP}–{ATP}. One molecule of {TNP}–{ATP} was bound in the monomeric state and two {TNP}–{ATP} molecules were detected in the dimeric state of {OpuAA}. Binding of {TNP}–{ADP}/Mg2+ to dimeric {OpuAA} induced a conformational change that led to the decay of the dimer. On the basis of our data, we propose a model that couples changes in the oligomeric state of {OpuAA} with {ATP} hydrolysis.},

	abstract = {{ATP}-sensitive K+ channels are the target for K+channel openers such as pinacidil. These channels are formed from pore-forming Kir6.2 and regulatory sulfonylurea receptor ({SUR}) subunits. Pinacidil activates channels containing {SUR}2A (heart, skeletal muscle), but not those containing {SUR}1 (beta cells). Surprisingly, binding of the pinacidil analog [3H]P1075 is dependent on added nucleotides, yet in electrophysiological studies, pinacidil is effective in the absence of intracellular nucleotides. To determine the reason for this anomaly, we examined the functional interactions between pinacidil (or P1075) and nucleotides by expressing cloned Kir6.2/{SUR}2A channels in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Both pinacidil and P1075 activated macroscopic Kir6.2/{SUR}2A currents in the absence of added nucleotide, but the presence of intracellular {ATP} or {ADP} slowed the off-rate of the response. Mutation of the Walker A lysine in a single nucleotide binding domain ({NBD}) of {SUR}2A (K707A in {NBD}1, K1348A in {NBD}2), abolished this action of nucleotide. The K1348A mutation prevented stimulation by {MgADP} but had little effect on the amplitude of the pinacidil response. In contrast, Kir6.2/{SUR}2A-K707A currents were activated by {MgADP}, but only responded to pinacidil in the presence of Mg-nucleotide. Off-rates in the absence (or presence) of nucleotide were slower for the pinacidil analog P1075 than for pinacidil, consistent with the higher affinity of P1075. We suggest that slowing of P1075 dissociation by nucleotide enables binding to be detected.},

This difference spectrum was similar to that of {TNP}-{ATP} or {TNP}-adenosine produced by 20\% (v/v) ethyleneglycol perturbation. The positive peak at 495 nm in the difference spectrum due to the binding of {TNP}-adenosine to heavy meromyosin shifted toward 505 nm, when pyrophosphate or {ATP} was added to the reaction mixture. These results suggest that the difference spectrum of {TNP}-{ATP} due to the interaction with heavy meromyosin arises not only from the binding of the chromophoric portion of the {TNP}-{ATP} molecule but also from that of the phosphate portion.},

	abstract = {Cyclic nucleotide-gated ({CNG}) ion channels mediate sensory signal transduction in photoreceptors and olfactory cells. Structurally, {CNG} channels are heterotetramers composed of either two or three homologue subunits1,2,3,4. Although it is well established that activation is a cooperative process of these subunits5, it remains unknown whether the cooperativity is generated by the ligand binding, the gating, or both, and how the subunits interact. In this study, the action of homotetrameric olfactory-type {CNGA}2 channels6 was studied in inside-out membrane patches by simultaneously determining channel activation and ligand binding, using the fluorescent {cGMP} analogue 8-{DY}547-{cGMP} as the ligand. At concentrations of 8-{DY}547-{cGMP} {\textless} 1 μM, steady-state binding was larger than steady-state activation, whereas at higher concentrations it was smaller, generating a crossover of the steady-state relationships. Global analysis of these relationships together with multiple activation time courses following {cGMP} jumps7 showed that four ligands bind to the channels and that there is significant interaction between the binding sites. Among the binding steps, the second is most critical for channel opening: its association constant is three orders of magnitude smaller than the others and it triggers a switch from a mostly closed to a maximally open state. These results contribute to unravelling the role of the subunits in the cooperative mechanism of {CNGA}2 channel activation and could be of general relevance for the action of other ion channels and receptors.},

These channels play crucial roles in many essential physiological processes and have been implicated extensively in a spectrum of metabolic diseases and disorders. To gain insight into the mechanism of {KATP}, we elucidated the structure of a hetero-octameric pancreatic {KATP} channel in complex with a non-competitive inhibitor glibenclamide by single-particle cryoelectron microscopy to 5.6-Å resolution. The structure shows that four {SUR}1 regulatory subunits locate peripherally and dock onto the central Kir6.2 channel tetramer through the {SUR}1 {TMD}0-L0 fragment. Glibenclamide-bound {SUR}1 uses {TMD}0-L0 fragment to stabilize Kir6.2 channel in a closed conformation. In another structural population, a putative co-purified phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate ({PIP}2) molecule uncouples Kir6.2 from glibenclamide-bound {SUR}1. These structural observations suggest a molecular mechanism for {KATP} regulation by anti-diabetic sulfonylurea drugs, intracellular adenosine nucleotide concentrations, and {PIP}2 lipid.},

Coexpression of betaα polypeptides with α monomers inhibited the K+ currents, while coexpression with beta monomers did not. We then constructed another single polypeptide (betaα2) consisting of a beta subunit and a dimeric repeat of the α subunit. 86Rb+ efflux from {COS}1 cells expressing betaα2 polypeptides was small, but was restored by supplementation with beta monomers. These results indicate that the activity of {KATP} channels is optimized when the α and beta subunits are coexpressed with a molar ratio of 1:1. Since inward rectifier K+ channels are thought to function as homo- or hetero-tetramers, this suggests that the {KATP} channel functions as a multimeric protein, most likely a hetero-octamer composed of a tetramer of the Kir6.2 subunit and a tetramer of the {SUR}1 subunit.},

To understand subunit stoichiometry for the {ATP}-dependent channel gating, we constructed tandem-multimeric Kir6.2 channels by selective disruption of the binding or gating mechanism in certain subunits. Stepwise disruptions of channel gating caused graded losses in {ATP} sensitivity and increases in basal Popen, with no effect on maximum {ATP} inhibition. Prevention of {ATP} binding lowered the {ATP} sensitivity and maximum inhibition without affecting basal Popen. The {ATP}-dependent gating required a minimum of two functional subunits. Two adjacent subunits are more favorable for {ATP} binding than two diagonal ones. Subunits showed negative cooperativity in {ATP} binding and positive cooperativity in channel gating. Joint disruptions of the binding and gating mechanisms in the same or alternate subunits of a concatemer revealed that both intra- and intersubunit couplings contributed to channel gating, although the binding-gating coupling preferred the intrasubunit to intersubunit configuration within the C terminus. No such preference was found between the C and N termini. These phenomena are well-described with the operational model used widely for ligand-receptor interactions.},

	abstract = {In pancreatic beta cells, insulin secretion is tightly controlled by the cells’ metabolic state via the {ATP}-sensitive potassium ({KATP}) channel. {ATP} is a key mediator in this signaling process, where its role as an inhibitor of {KATP} channels has been extensively studied. Since the channel contains an {ATPase} as an accessory subunit, the possibility that {ATP} hydrolysis mediates {KATP} channel opening has also been proposed. However, a rigorous test of coupling between {ATP} hydrolysis and channel gating has not previously been performed. In the present work, we examine whether {KATP} channel gating obeys detailed balance in order to determine whether {ATP} hydrolysis is strongly coupled to the gating of the {KATP} channel. Single-channel records were obtained from inside-out patches of transiently transfected {HEK}-293 cells. Channel activity in membrane patches with exactly one channel shows no violations of microscopic reversibility. Although {KATP} channel gating shows long closed times on the time scale where {ATP} hydrolysis takes place, the time symmetry of channel gating indicates that it is not tightly coupled to {ATP} hydrolysis. This lack of coupling suggests that channel gating operates close to equilibrium; although detailed balance is not expected to hold for {ATP} hydrolysis, it still does so in channel gating. On the basis of these results, the function of the {ATPase} active site in channel gating may be to sense nucleotides by differential binding of {ATP} and {ADP}, rather than to drive a thermodynamically unfavorable conformational change.},

	abstract = {1 We have examined the mechanism by which nucleotides modulate the tolbutamide block of the beta-cell {ATP}-sensitive K+ channel ({KATP} channel), using wild-type and mutant {KATP} channels heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. This channel is composed of sulphonylurea receptor ({SUR}1) and pore-forming (Kir6.2) subunits. 2 The dose–response relation for tolbutamide block of wild-type {KATP} currents in the absence of nucleotide showed both a high-affinity (Ki=2.0 μm) and a low-affinity (Ki=1.8 mm) site. 3 The dose–response relation for tolbutamide block of Kir6.2{ΔC}36 (a truncated form of Kir6.2 which is expressed independently of {SUR}1) was best fitted with a single, low-affinity site (Ki=1.7 mm). This indicates that the high-affinity site resides on {SUR}1, whereas the low-affinity site is located on Kir6.2. 4 {ADP} (100 μM) had a dual effect on wild-type {KATP} currents: the nucleotide enhanced the current in the presence of Mg2+, but was inhibitory in the absence of Mg2+. Kir6.2{ΔC}36 currents were blocked by 100 μM {ADP} in the presence of Mg2+. 5 For wild-type {KATP} currents, the blocking effect of 0.5 mm tolbutamide appeared greater in the presence of 100 μm {MgADP} (84 ± 2\%) than in its absence (59 ± 4\%). When {SUR}1 was mutated to abolish {MgADP} activation of {KATP} currents (K719A or K1384M), there was no difference in the extent of tolbutamide inhibition in the presence or absence of {MgADP}. 6 The ki for tolbutamide interaction with either the high- or low-affinity site was unaffected by 100 μM {MgADP}, for both wild-type and K719A-K1384M currents. 7 {MgGDP} (100{μM}) enhanced wild-type {KATP} currents and was without effect on K719A– K1384M currents. It did not affect the ki for tolbutamide block at either the high- or low-affinity site. 8 Our results indicate that interaction of tolbutamide with the high-affinity site (on {SUR}1) abolishes the stimulatory action of {MgADP}. This unmasks the inhibitory effect of {ADP} and leads to an apparent increase in channel inhibition. Under physiological conditions, abolition of {MgADP} activation is likely to constitute the principal mechanism by which tolbutamide inhibits the {KATP} channel.},

	abstract = {{ATP}-sensitive potassium channels (K-{ATP} channels) couple cell metabolism to electrical activity and are important in the physiology and pathophysiology of many tissues1. In pancreatic beta-cells, K-{ATP} channels link changes in blood glucose concentration to insulin secretion2. They are also the target for clinically important drugs such as sulphonylureas, which stimulate secretion, and the K+ channel opener diazoxide, which inhibits insulin release3,4. Metabolic regulation of K-{ATP} channels is mediated by changes in intracellular {ATP} and Mg-{ADP} levels, which inhibit and activate the channel, respectively2. The beta-cell K-{ATP} channel is a complex of two proteins5,6: an inward-rectifier K+ channel subunit, Kir6.2, and the sulphonylurea receptor, {SUR}1. We show here that the primary site at which {ATP} acts to mediate K-{ATP} channel inhibition is located on Kir6.2, and that {SUR}1 is required for sensitivity to sulphonylureas and diazoxide and for activation by Mg-{ADP}.},

	abstract = {{TNP}-modified nucleotides have been used extensively to study protein–nucleotide interactions. In the case of {ABC}-{ATPases}, application of these powerful tools has been greatly restricted due to the significantly higher affinity of the {TNP}-nucleotide for the corresponding {ABC}-{ATPase} in comparison to the non-modified nucleotides. To understand the molecular changes occurring upon binding of the {TNP}-nucleotide to an {ABC}-{ATPase}, we have determined the crystal structure of the {TNP}–{ADP}/{HlyB}–{NBD} complex at 1.6Å resolution. Despite the higher affinity of {TNP}–{ADP}, no direct fluorophore–protein interactions were observed. Unexpectedly, only water-mediated interactions were detected between the {TNP} moiety and Tyr477, that is engaged in π–π stacking with the adenine ring, as well as with two serine residues (Ser504 and Ser509) of the Walker A motif. Interestingly, the side chains of these two serine residues adopt novel conformations that are not observed in the corresponding {ADP} structure. However, in the crystal structure of the S504A mutant, which binds {TNP}–{ADP} with similar affinity to the wild type enzyme, a novel {TNP}–water interaction compensates for the missing serine side chain. Since this water molecule is not present in the wild type enzyme, these results suggest that only water-mediated interactions provide a structural explanation for the increased affinity of {TNP}-nucleotides towards {ABC}-{ATPases}. However, our results also imply that in silico approaches such as docking or modeling cannot directly be applied to generate ‘affinity-adopted’ {ADP}- or {ATP}-analogs for {ABC}-{ATPases}.},

The healthy beta-cell acts as a glucose sensor matching its output to the circulating glucose concentration. It does so via metabolically induced changes in electrical activity, which culminate in an increase in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration and initiation of Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of insulin-containing secretory granules. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of the beta-cell transcriptome, electrical activity, and insulin exocytosis. We highlight salient differences between mouse and human beta-cells, provide models of how the different ion channels contribute to their electrical activity and insulin secretion, and conclude by discussing how these processes become perturbed in T2DM.},

	abstract = {Adenosine triphosphate ({ATP})–sensitive K+ ({KATP}) channels are molecular sensors of cell metabolism. These hetero-octameric channels, comprising four inward rectifier K+ channel subunits (Kir6.1 or Kir6.2) and four sulfonylurea receptor ({SUR}1 or {SUR}2A/B) subunits, detect metabolic changes via three classes of intracellular adenine nucleotide ({ATP}/{ADP}) binding site. One site, located on the Kir subunit, causes inhibition of the channel when {ATP} or {ADP} is bound. The other two sites, located on the {SUR} subunit, excite the channel when bound to Mg nucleotides. In pancreatic beta cells, an increase in extracellular glucose causes a change in oxidative metabolism and thus turnover of adenine nucleotides in the cytoplasm. This leads to the closure of {KATP} channels, which depolarizes the plasma membrane and permits Ca2+ influx and insulin secretion. Many of the molecular details regarding the assembly of the {KATP} complex, and how changes in nucleotide concentrations affect gating, have recently been uncovered by several single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structures of the pancreatic {KATP} channel (Kir6.2/{SUR}1) at near-atomic resolution. Here, the author discusses the detailed picture of excitatory and inhibitory ligand binding to {KATP} that these structures present and suggests a possible mechanism by which channel activation may proceed from the ligand-binding domains of {SUR} to the channel pore.},

The activity of these channels is primarily determined by intracellular adenosine nucleotides, which have both inhibitory and stimulatory effects. The role of {KATP} channels has been studied most extensively in pancreatic beta-cells, where they link glucose metabolism to insulin secretion. Many mutations in {KATP} channel subunits (Kir6.2, {SUR}1) have been identified that cause either neonatal diabetes or congenital hyperinsulinism. Thus, a mechanistic understanding of {KATP} channel behavior is necessary for modeling beta-cell electrical activity and insulin release in both health and disease. Here, we review recent advances in the {KATP} channel structure and function. We focus on the molecular mechanisms of {KATP} channel gating by adenosine nucleotides, phospholipids and sulphonylureas and consider the advantages and limitations of various mathematical models of macroscopic and single-channel {KATP} currents. Finally, we outline future directions for the development of more realistic models of {KATP} channel gating.},

These studies have revealed numerous and important differences between human and rodent beta cells. Here we discuss the properties of human pancreatic beta cells: their glucose sensing, the ion channel complement underlying glucose-induced electrical activity that culminates in exocytotic release of insulin, the cellular control of exocytosis, and the modulation of insulin secretion by circulating hormones and locally released neurotransmitters. Finally, we consider the pathophysiology of insulin secretion and the interactions between genetics and environmental factors that may explain the current diabetes epidemic.},

By using either a single- or multi-step approach, we establish a consistent value for the binding of {PIP}2 to {hKir} channels, relative to the binding of the bulk phosphatidylcholine phospholipid. Furthermore, by perturbing amino acid side chains on {hKir}6.2, we show that the neonatal diabetes mutation E179K increases {PIP}2 affinity, while the congenital hyperinsulinism mutation K67N results in a reduced affinity. We show good agreement with electrophysiological data where E179K exhibits a reduction in neomycin sensitivity, implying that {PIP}2 binds more tightly E179K channels. This illustrates the application of {CG}-{FEP} to compare affinities between lipid species, and for annotating amino acid residues.},

	abstract = {Functional integrity of pancreatic adenosine triphosphate ({ATP})-sensitive potassium ({KATP}) channels depends on the interactions between the pore-forming potassium channel subunit Kir6.2 and the regulatory subunit sulfonylurea receptor 1 ({SUR}1). Previous studies have shown that the N-terminal transmembrane domain of {SUR}1 ({TMD}0) interacts with Kir6.2 and is sufficient to confer high intrinsic open probability (Po) and bursting patterns of activity observed in full-length {KATP} channels. However, the nature of {TMD}0–Kir6.2 interactions that underlie gating modulation is not well understood. Using two previously described disease-causing mutations in {TMD}0 (R74W and E128K), we performed amino acid substitutions to study the structural roles of these residues in {KATP} channel function in the context of full-length {SUR}1 as well as {TMD}0. Our results revealed that although R74W and E128K in full-length {SUR}1 both decrease surface channel expression and reduce channel sensitivity to {ATP} inhibition, they arrive there via distinct mechanisms. Mutation of R74 uniformly reduced {TMD}0 protein levels, suggesting that R74 is necessary for stability of {TMD}0. In contrast, E128 mutations retained {TMD}0 protein levels but reduced functional coupling between {TMD}0 and Kir6.2 in mini-{KATP} channels formed by {TMD}0 and Kir6.2. Importantly, E128K full-length channels, despite having a greatly reduced Po, exhibit little response to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate ({PIP}2) stimulation. This is reminiscent of Kir6.2 channel behavior in the absence of {SUR}1 and suggests that {TMD}0 controls Kir6.2 gating by modulating Kir6.2 interactions with {PIP}2. Further supporting this notion, the E128W mutation in full-length channels resulted in channel inactivation that was prevented or reversed by exogenous {PIP}2. These results identify a critical determinant in {TMD}0 that controls Kir6.2 gating by controlling channel sensitivity to {PIP}2. Moreover, they uncover a novel mechanism of {KATP} channel inactivation involving aberrant functional coupling between {SUR}1 and Kir6.2.},

Interaction of adenine nucleotides with Kir6.2 positively charged amino acids such as K185 and R201 on the C-terminus causes channel closure. Substitution of these amino acids with other positively charged residues had small effects on inhibition by adenine nucleotide, while substitution with neutral or negative residues had major effects, suggesting electrostatic interactions between Kir6.2 positive charges and adenine nucleotide negative phosphate groups. Furthermore, R201 mutation decreased channel sensitivity to {ATP}, {ADP}, and {AMP} to a similar extent, but K185 mutation decreased primarily {ATP} and {ADP} sensitivity, leaving the {AMP} sensitivity relatively unaffected. Thus, channel inhibition by {ATP} may involve interaction of the α-phosphate with R201 and interaction of the beta-phosphate with K185. In addition, decreased open probability due to rundown or sulfonylureas caused an increase in {ATP} sensitivity in the K185 mutant, but not in the R201 mutant. Thus, the beta-phosphate may bind in a state-independent fashion to K185 to destabilize channel openings, while R201 interacts with the α-phosphate to stabilize a channel closed configuration. Substitution of R192 on the C-terminus and R50 on the N-terminus with different charged residues also affected {ATP} sensitivity. Based on these results a structural scheme is proposed, which includes features of other recently published models.},

	abstract = {{KATP} channels are a functional complex of sulphonylurea receptor ({SUR}1, {SUR}2) and inward rectifier K+ (Kir6.1, Kir6.2) channel subunits. We have studied the role of the putative pore forming subunit (Kir6.2) in regulation of rectification and gating of {KATP} channels generated by transfection of {SUR}1 and Kir6.2 {cDNAs} in {COSm}6 cells. In the absence of internal polyvalent cations, the current-voltage relationship is sigmoidal. Mg2+ or spermine4+ (spm) each induces a mild inward rectification. Mutation of the asparagine at position 160 in Kir6.2 to aspartate (N160D) or glutamate (N160E) increases the degree of rectification induced by Mg2+ or spermine4+, whereas wild-type rectification is still observed after mutation to other neutral residues (alanine–N160A, glutamine–N160Q). These results are consistent with this residue lining the pore of the channel and contributing to the binding of these cations, as demonstrated for the equivalent site in homomeric {ROMK}1 (Kir1.1) channels. Since Kir6.2 contains no consensus {ATP} binding site, whereas {SUR}1 does, inhibition by {ATP} has been assumed to depend on interactions with {SUR}1. However, we found that the [{ATP}] causing half-maximal inhibition of current (Ki) was affected by mutation of N160. Channels formed from N160D or N160Q mutant subunits had lower apparent sensitivity to {ATP} (Ki,N160D = 46.1 μM; Ki,N160Q = 62.9 μM) than wild-type, N160E, or N160A channels (Ki = 10.4, 17.7, 6.4 μM, respectively). This might suggest that {ATP} binding to the channel complex was altered, although examination of channel open probabilities indicates instead that the residue at position 160 alters the {ATP}-independent open probability, i.e., it controls the free energy of the open state, thereby affecting the “coupling” of {ATP} binding to channel inhibition. The results can be interpreted in terms of a kinetic scheme whereby the residue at Kir6.2 position 160 controls the rate constants governing transitions to and from the open state, without directly affecting {ATP} binding or unbinding transitions.},

	abstract = {1 To gain insight into the role of the cytoplasmic regions of the Kir6.2 subunit in regulating channel activity, we have expressed the sulphonylurea receptor {SUR}1 with Kir6.2 subunits containing systematic truncations of the N- and C-termini. Up to 30 amino acids could be truncated from the N-terminus, and up to 36 amino acids from the C-terminus without loss of functional channels in co-expression with {SUR}1. Furthermore, Kir6.2{ΔC}25 and Kir6.2{ΔC}36 subunits expressed functional channels in the absence of {SUR}1. 2 In co-expression with {SUR}1, N-terminal truncations increased Ki,atp ([{ATP}] causing half-maximal inhibition of channel activity) by as much as 10-fold, accompanied by an increase in the {ATP}-insensitive open probability, whereas the C-terminal truncations did not affect the {ATP} sensitivity of co-expressed channels. 3 A mutation in the near C-terminal region, K185Q, reduced {ATP} sensitivity of co-expressed channels by approximately 30-fold, and on the Kir6.2{ΔN}2-30 background, this mutation decreased {ATP} sensitivity of co-expressed channels by approximately 400-fold. 4 Each of these mutations also reduced the sensitivity to inhibition by {ADP}, {AMP} and adenosine tetraphosphate. 5 The results can be quantitatively explained by assuming that the N-terminal deletions stabilize the {ATP}-independent open state, whereas the Kir6.2K185Q mutation may alter the stability of {ATP} binding. These two effects are energetically additive, causing the large reduction of {ATP} sensitivity in the double mutant channels.},

	abstract = {{ATP}-sensitive potassium ({KATP}) channels are formed by the coassembly of four Kir6.2 subunits and four sulfonylurea receptor subunits ({SUR}). The cytoplasmic domains of Kir6.2 mediate channel gating by {ATP}, which closes the channel, and membrane phosphoinositides, which stabilize the open channel. Little is known, however, about the tertiary or quaternary structures of the domains that are responsible for these interactions. Here, we report that an ion pair between glutamate 229 and arginine 314 in the intracellular {COOH} terminus of Kir6.2 is critical for maintaining channel activity. Mutation of either residue to alanine induces inactivation, whereas charge reversal at positions 229 and 314 (E229R/R314E) abolishes inactivation and restores the wild-type channel phenotype. The close proximity of these two residues is demonstrated by disulfide bond formation between cysteine residues introduced at the two positions (E229C/R314C); disulfide bond formation abolishes inactivation and stabilizes the current. Using Kir6.2 tandem dimer constructs, we provide evidence that the ion pair likely forms by residues from two adjacent Kir6.2 subunits. We propose that the E229/R314 intersubunit ion pairs may contribute to a structural framework that facilitates the ability of other positively charged residues to interact with membrane phosphoinositides. Glutamate and arginine residues are found at homologous positions in many inward rectifier subunits, including the G-protein–activated inwardly rectifying potassium channel ({GIRK}), whose cytoplasmic domain structure has recently been solved. In the {GIRK} structure, the E229- and R314-corresponding residues are oriented in opposite directions in a single subunit such that in the tetramer model, the E229 equivalent residue from one subunit is in close proximity of the R314 equivalent residue from the adjacent subunit. The structure lends support to our findings in Kir6.2, and raises the possibility that a homologous ion pair may be involved in the gating of {GIRKs}.},

Functional studies demonstrated that {PNDM} mutations reduce {KATP} channel sensitivity to {ATP} inhibition, resulting in gain of channel function. However, the impact of these mutations on channel expression has not been examined. Here, we show that {PNDM} mutations, including Q52R, V59G, V59M, R201C, R201H, and I296L, not only reduce channel {ATP} sensitivity but also impair channel expression at the cell surface to varying degrees. By tagging the {PNDM} Kir6.2 mutant V59G or R201H with an additional mutation, N160D, that confers voltage-dependent polyamine block of {KATP} channels, we demonstrate that in simulated heterozygous state, all surface channels are either wild-type or heteromeric channels containing both wild-type and mutant Kir6.2 subunits. Comparison of the various {PNDM} mutations in their effects on channel nucleotide sensitivity and expression, as well as disease phenotype, suggests that both channel-gating defect and expression level may play a role in determining disease severity. Interestingly, sulfonylureas significantly increase surface expression of certain {PNDM} mutants, suggesting that the efficacy of sulfonylurea therapy may be compromised by the effect of these drugs on channel expression.},

We report here that sulfonylureas also function as chemical chaperones to rescue {KATP} channel trafficking defects caused by two {SUR}1 mutations, A116P and V187D, identified in patients with congenital hyperinsulinism. Sulfonylureas markedly increased cell surface expression of the A116P and V187D mutants by stabilizing the mutant {SUR}1 proteins and promoting their maturation. By contrast, diazoxide, a potassium channel opener that also binds {SUR}1, had no effect on surface expression of either mutant. Importantly, both mutant channels rescued to the cell surface have normal {ATP}, {MgADP}, and diazoxide sensitivities, demonstrating that {SUR}1 harboring either the A116P or the V187D mutation is capable of associating with Kir6.2 to form functional {KATP} channels.

Loss of {KATP} channel function due to mutations in {ABCC}8 or {KCNJ}11, genes that encode the sulfonylurea receptor 1 or the inward rectifier Kir6.2 subunit of the channel, is a major cause of congenital hyperinsulinism. Here, we report identification of a novel {KCNJ}11 mutation associated with the disease that renders a missense mutation, F55L, in the Kir6.2 protein. Mutant channels reconstituted in {COS} cells exhibited a wild-type-like surface expression level and normal sensitivity to {ATP}, {MgADP}, and diazoxide. However, the intrinsic open probability of the mutant channel was greatly reduced, by ∼10-fold. This low open probability defect could be reversed by application of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphates or oleoyl-{CoA} to the cytoplasmic face of the channel, indicating that reduced channel response to membrane phospholipids and/or long chain acyl-{CoAs} underlies the low intrinsic open probability in the mutant. Our findings reveal a novel molecular mechanism for loss of {KATP} channel function and congenital hyperinsulinism and support the importance of phospholipids and/or long chain acyl-{CoAs} in setting the physiological activity of beta-cell {KATP} channels. The F55L mutation is located in the slide helix of Kir6.2. Several permanent neonatal diabetes-associated mutations found in the same structure have the opposite effect of increasing intrinsic channel open probability. Our results also highlight the critical role of the Kir6.2 slide helix in determining the intrinsic open probability of {KATP} channels.},

	abstract = {{KATP} channels can be formed from Kir6.2 subunits with or without {SUR}1. The open-state stability of {KATP} channels can be increased or reduced by mutations throughout the Kir6.2 subunit, and is increased by application of {PIP}2 to the cytoplasmic membrane. Increase of open-state stability is manifested as an increase in the channel open probability in the absence of {ATP} (Pozero) and a correlated decrease in sensitivity to inhibition by {ATP}. Single channel lifetime analyses were performed on wild-type and I154C mutant channels expressed with, and without, {SUR}1. Channel kinetics include a single, invariant, open duration; an invariant, brief, closed duration; and longer closed events consisting of a “mixture of exponentials,” which are prolonged in {ATP} and shortened after {PIP}2 treatment. The steady-state and kinetic data cannot be accounted for by assuming that {ATP} binds to the channel and causes a gate to close. Rather, we show that they can be explained by models that assume the following regarding the gating behavior: 1) the channel undergoes {ATP}-insensitive transitions from the open state to a short closed state (Cf) and to a longer-lived closed state (C0); 2) the C0 state is destabilized in the presence of {SUR}1; and 3) {ATP} can access this C0 state, stabilizing it and thereby inhibiting macroscopic currents. The effect of {PIP}2 and mutations that stabilize the open state is then to shift the equilibrium of the “critical transition” from the open state to the {ATP}-accessible C0 state toward the O state, reducing accessibility of the C0 state, and hence reducing {ATP} sensitivity.},

The stimulatory action of Mg-nucleotides complicates analysis of nucleotide inhibition of Kir6.2/{SUR}1 channels. We therefore used a truncated isoform of Kir6.2, that expresses {ATP}-sensitive channels in the absence of {SUR}1, to explore the mechanism of nucleotide inhibition. We found that Kir6.2 is highly selective for {ATP}, and that both the adenine moiety and the ?-phosphate contribute to specificity. We also identified several mutations that significantly reduce {ATP} inhibition. These are located in two distinct regions of Kir6.2: the N-terminus preceding, and the C-terminus immediately following, the transmembrane domains. Some mutations in the C-terminus also markedly increased the channel open probability, which may account for the decrease in apparent {ATP} sensitivity. Other mutations did not affect the single-channel kinetics, and may reduce {ATP} inhibition by interfering with {ATP} binding and/or the link between {ATP} binding and pore closure.

A truncated isoform of Kir6.2 (Kir6.2{ΔC}26), which expresses independently of {SUR}1, shows intrinsic {ATP} sensitivity, suggesting that this subunit is primarily responsible for mediating {ATP} inhibition. We show here that mutation of C166, which lies at the cytosolic end of the second transmembrane domain, to serine (C166S) increases the open probability of Kir6.2{ΔC}26 approximately sevenfold by reducing the time the channel spends in a long closed state. Rundown of channel activity is also decreased. Kir6.2{ΔC}26 containing the C166S mutation shows a markedly reduced {ATP} sensitivity: the Ki is reduced from 175 μM to 2.8 {mM}. Substitution of threonine, alanine, methionine, or phenylalanine at position C166 also reduced the channel sensitivity to {ATP} and simultaneously increased the open probability. Thus, {ATP} does not act as an open channel blocker. The inhibitory effects of tolbutamide are reduced in channels composed of {SUR}1 and Kir6.2 carrying the C166S mutation. Our results are consistent with the idea that C166 plays a role in the intrinsic gating of the channel, possibly by influencing a gate located at the intracellular end of the pore. Kinetic analysis suggests that the apparent decrease in {ATP} sensitivity, and the changes in other properties, observed when C166 is mutated is largely a consequence of the impaired transition from the open to the long closed state.},

	abstract = {{ATP}-sensitive potassium ({KATP}) channels link cellular metabolism to electrical activity in nerve, muscle, and endocrine tissues. They are formed as a functional complex of two unrelated subunits—a member of the Kir inward rectifier potassium channel family, and a sulfonylurea receptor ({SUR}), a member of the {ATP}-binding cassette transporter family, which includes cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulators and multidrug resistance protein, regulators of chloride channel activity. This recent discovery has brought together proteins from two very distinct superfamilies in a novel functional complex. The pancreatic {KATP} channel is probably formed specifically of Kir6.2 and {SUR}1 isoforms. The relationship between {SUR}1 and Kir6.2 must be determined to understand how {SUR}1 and Kir6.2 interact to form this unique channel. We have used mutant Kir6.2 subunits and dimeric ({SUR}1-Kir6.2) constructs to examine the functional stoichiometry of the {KATP} channel. The data indicate that the {KATP} channel pore is lined by four Kir6.2 subunits, and that each Kir6.2 subunit requires one {SUR}1 subunit to generate a functional channel in an octameric or tetradimeric structure.},

Expression cloning of the first inward rectifier K channel (Kir) genes provided the necessary breakthrough that has led to isolation of a family of related clones encoding channels with the essential functional properties of classical inward rectifiers, {ATP}-sensitive K channels, and muscarinic receptor-activated K channels. High-level expression of cloned channels led to the discovery that classical inward so-called anomalous rectification is caused by voltage-dependent block of the channel by polyamines and Mg2+ ions, and it is now clear that a similar mechanism results in inward rectification of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate ({AMPA})-kainate receptor channels. Knowledge of the primary structures of Kir channels and the ability to mutate them also has led to the determination of many of the structural requirements of inward rectification.},

	abstract = {{ATP}-sensitive K ({KATP}) channels are blocked by {ATP} and activated by {PIP}2. Both negatively-charged ligands are presumed to bind to positively-charged residues on the N-and C-termini of the channel's cytoplasmic domain. Evidence summarized here suggests that the channel's interaction with {ATP} and {PIP}2 is regulated by separate groups of residues, involving both direct charge-charge interactions and allosteric effects. {ATP} interaction is regulated by R50 in the N-terminus and by K185, R192 and R201 in the C-terminus. R192 and R201 mutations decrease channel sensitivity to {ATP}, {ADP} and {AMP} to a similar extent, implying that they regulate interaction with either the α phosphate group, common to all three adenine nucleotides, or the adenosine moiety. K185 mutations, and to a lesser extent R50 mutations, decrease {ATP} and {ADP} sensitivity without markedly affecting {AMP} sensitivity, implying that they regulate interaction with the beta phosphate of {ATP} and {ADP}. In addition, when open probability decreases due to rundown, {ATP} sensitivity increases in R50, K185 and R192, but not in R201 mutants. Combining these observations with recent structural data, we hypothesize the following scenario: 1) the {ATP} binding site is located at the outside of the channel's cytoplasmic domain away from the pore. 2) When the channel is open, R50 and K185 interact directly with the beta phosphate of {ATP}, whereas R192, which appears to be removed from the {ATP} binding site, modulates the initial interaction with {ATP} allosterically. 3) When the channel closes, R201 is in position to interact with the α phosphate of {ATP} to stabilize the closed state. 4) {PIP}2 also interacts with the channel's cytoplasmic domain, but at distinct positively-charged residues located above the {ATP} binding site and near to the plasma membrane. These residues include R54 in the N-terminus and R176, R177 and R206 in the C-terminus. Thus, the binding domains of {ATP} and {PIP}2 in the N- and C-termini do not appear to overlap.},

The validity of the move from qualitative to quantitative analysis depends on the verbal and statistical expressions of a hypothesis being closely aligned—that is, that the two must refer to roughly the same set of hypothetical observations. Here I argue that many applications of statistical inference in psychology fail to meet this basic condition. Focusing on the most widely used class of model in psychology—the linear mixed model—I explore the consequences of failing to statistically operationalize verbal hypotheses in a way that respects researchers' actual generalization intentions. I demonstrate that whereas the "random effect" formalism is used pervasively in psychology to model inter-subject variability, few researchers accord the same treatment to other variables they clearly intend to generalize over (e.g., stimuli, tasks, or research sites). The under-specification of random effects imposes far stronger constraints on the generalizability of results than most researchers appreciate. Ignoring these constraints can dramatically inflate false positive rates, and often leads researchers to draw sweeping verbal generalizations that lack a meaningful connection to the statistical quantities they are putatively based on. I argue that failure to take the alignment between verbal and statistical expressions seriously lies at the heart of many of psychology's ongoing problems (e.g., the replication crisis), and conclude with a discussion of several potential avenues for improvement.},

Here, we show that leak expression may be mediated by reinitiation and can result in unwanted proteins when stop codons for {UAA} insertion are mutated into the N-terminus of proteins. We demonstrate that up to 25\% of leak expression occurs through reinitiation in the Shaker-Kv channel when stop codons are located within the first 70 amino acids. Several non-canonical start codons were identified as translation reinitaition sites and by removing the start codons, we were able to decrease leak expression to less than 1\%. Our study emphasizes the need to carefully inspect for leak expression when inserting {UAAs} and demonstrates how leak expression can be eliminated.},

In mammals, reinitiation is most efficient when the termination codon is positioned close to the 5′-proximal initiation site and around 78 bases upstream of the reinitiation site. The phenomenon was studied mainly in the context of open reading frames ({ORFs}) found within the 5′-untranslated region, or polycicstronic viral {mRNA}. We hypothesized that reinitiation of translation following nonsense mutations within the main {ORF} of p53 can promote the expression of N-truncated p53 isoforms such as Δ40, Δ133 and Δ160p53. Here, we report that expression of all known N-truncated p53 isoforms by reinitiation is mechanistically feasible, including expression of the previously unidentified variant Δ66p53. Moreover, we found that significant reinitiation of translation can be promoted by nonsense mutations located even 126 codons downstream of the 5′-proximal initiation site, and observed when the reinitiation site is positioned between 6 and 243 bases downstream of the nonsense mutation. We also demonstrate that reinitiation can stabilise p53 {mRNA} transcripts with a premature termination codon, by allowing such transcripts to evade the nonsense mediated decay pathway. Our data suggest that the expression of N-truncated proteins from alleles carrying a premature termination codon is more prevalent than previously thought.},

	abstract = {{TNP}-modified nucleotides have been used extensively to study protein–nucleotide interactions. In the case of {ABC}-{ATPases}, application of these powerful tools has been greatly restricted due to the significantly higher affinity of the {TNP}-nucleotide for the corresponding {ABC}-{ATPase} in comparison to the non-modified nucleotides. To understand the molecular changes occurring upon binding of the {TNP}-nucleotide to an {ABC}-{ATPase}, we have determined the crystal structure of the {TNP}–{ADP}/{HlyB}–{NBD} complex at 1.6Å resolution. Despite the higher affinity of {TNP}–{ADP}, no direct fluorophore–protein interactions were observed. Unexpectedly, only water-mediated interactions were detected between the {TNP} moiety and Tyr477, that is engaged in π–π stacking with the adenine ring, as well as with two serine residues (Ser504 and Ser509) of the Walker A motif. Interestingly, the side chains of these two serine residues adopt novel conformations that are not observed in the corresponding {ADP} structure. However, in the crystal structure of the S504A mutant, which binds {TNP}–{ADP} with similar affinity to the wild type enzyme, a novel {TNP}–water interaction compensates for the missing serine side chain. Since this water molecule is not present in the wild type enzyme, these results suggest that only water-mediated interactions provide a structural explanation for the increased affinity of {TNP}-nucleotides towards {ABC}-{ATPases}. However, our results also imply that in silico approaches such as docking or modeling cannot directly be applied to generate ‘affinity-adopted’ {ADP}- or {ATP}-analogs for {ABC}-{ATPases}.},

	abstract = {A bio-orthogonal and unnatural substance, such as an unnatural amino acid (Uaa), is an ideal regulator to control target gene expression in a synthetic gene circuit. Genetic code expansion technology has achieved Uaa incorporation into ribosomal synthesized proteins in vivo at specific sites designated by {UAG} stop codons. This site-specific Uaa incorporation can be used as a controller of target gene expression at the translational level by conditional read-through of internal {UAG} stop codons. Recent advances in optimization of site-specific Uaa incorporation for translational regulation have enabled more precise control over a wide range of novel important applications, such as Uaa-auxotrophy-based biological containment, live-attenuated vaccine, and high-yield zero-leakage expression systems, in which Uaa translational control is exclusively used as an essential genetic element. This review summarizes the history and recent advance of the translational control by conditional stop codon read-through, especially focusing on the methods using the site-specific Uaa incorporation.},

Deletion of release factor 1 in Escherichia coli enhances translation of {UAG} (Stop) codons, yet may also extended protein synthesis at natural {UAG} terminated messenger {RNAs}. The fidelity of protein synthesis at reassigned {UAG} codons and the purity of the {NSAA} containing proteins produced require careful examination. Proteomics would be an ideal tool for these tasks, but conventional proteomic analyses cannot readily identify the extended proteins and accurately discover multiple amino acid ({AA}) insertions at a single {UAG}. To address these challenges, we created a new proteomic workflow that enabled the detection of {UAG} readthrough in native proteins in E. coli strains in which {UAG} was reassigned to encode phosphoserine. The method also enabled quantitation of {NSAA} and natural {AA} incorporation at {UAG} in a recombinant reporter protein. As a proof-of-principle, we measured the fidelity and purity of the phosphoserine orthogonal translation system ({OTS}) and used this information to improve its performance. Our results show a surprising diversity of natural {AAs} at reassigned stop codons. Our method can be used to improve {OTSs} and to quantify amino acid purity at reassigned codons in organisms with expanded genetic codes.},

Here we present new strategies for generating orthogonal {tRNA}-synthetase pairs, which made possible the genetic encoding of diverse unnatural amino acids in different mammalian cells and primary neurons. Using this new methodology, we incorporated unnatural amino acids with extended side chains into the K+ channel Kv1.4, and found that the bulkiness of residues in the inactivation peptide is essential for fast channel inactivation, a finding that had not been possible using conventional mutagenesis. This technique will stimulate and facilitate new molecular studies using tailored unnatural amino acids for cell biology and neurobiology.},

We examined the influence of these downstream nucleotides on translation termination success or failure in mammalian cells at the three stop codons. The expected hierarchy in the intrinsic fidelity of the stop codons ({UAA}\&gt;{UAG}\&gt;\&gt;{UGA}) was observed, with highly influential effects on termination readthrough mediated by nucleotides at position +4 and position +8. A more complex influence was observed from the nucleotides at positions +5 and +6. The weakest termination contexts were most affected by increases or decreases in the concentration of the decoding release factor ({eRF}1), indicating that {eRF}1 binding to these signals was rate-limiting. When termination efficiency was significantly reduced by cognate suppressor {tRNAs}, the observed influence of downstream nucleotides was maintained. There was a positive correlation between experimentally measured signal strength and frequency of the signal in eukaryotic genomes, particularly in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster. We propose that termination efficiency is not only influenced by interrogation of the stop signal directly by the release factor, but also by downstream ribosomal interactions with the {mRNA} nucleotides in the entry channel.},

	abstract = {It is well known that stop codons play a critical role in the process of protein synthesis. However, little effort has been made to investigate whether stop codon usage exhibits biases, such as widely seen for synonymous codon usage. Here we systematically investigate stop codon usage bias in various eukaryotes as well as its relationships with its context, {GC}3 content, gene expression level, and secondary structure. The results show that there is a strong bias for stop codon usage in different eukaryotes, i.e., {UAA} is overrepresented in the lower eukaryotes, {UGA} is overrepresented in the higher eukaryotes, and {UAG} is least used in all eukaryotes. Different conserved patterns for each stop codon in different eukaryotic classes are found based on information content and logo analysis. {GC}3 contents increase with increasing complexity of organisms. Secondary structure prediction revealed that {UAA} is generally associated with loop structures, whereas {UGA} is more uniformly present in loop and stem structures, i.e., {UGA} is less biased toward having a particular structure. The stop codon usage bias, however, shows no significant relationship with {GC}3 content and gene expression level in individual eukaryotes. The results indicate that genomic complexity and {GC}3 content might contribute to stop codon usage bias in different eukaryotes. Our results indicate that stop codons, like synonymous codons, exhibit biases in usage. Additional work will be needed to understand the causes of these biases and their relationship to the mechanism of protein termination.},

Methods Medical records of patients with {wAMD}, who started ranibizumab treatment between 1 January 2009 and 31 August 2009, were evaluated. Data were collected until the end of treatment and/or monitoring or until 31 August 2011.
Results 2227 patients who received ≥1 anti-{VEGF} injection with a baseline visual acuity assessment and ≥1 postbaseline visual acuity assessment for the treated eye were evaluated. Visual acuity improved until about day 120; thereafter, visual acuity gains were not maintained. Mean change in visual acuity score from baseline to years 1 and 2 was +2.4 and +0.6 letters, respectively. Patients received a mean of 5.0 and 2.2 injections in the first and second year, respectively. There were substantial differences in visual outcomes and injection frequency between countries. More frequent visits and injections were associated with greater improvements in visual acuity.
Conclusions In clinical practice, fewer injections are administered than in clinical trials. Anti-{VEGF} treatment resulted in an initial improvement in visual acuity; however, this was not maintained over time.

Multilevel models have become a standard data analysis approach in intervention research. Although the vast majority of intervention studies involve multiple outcome measures, few studies use multivariate analysis methods. The authors discuss multivariate extensions to the multilevel model that can be used by psychotherapy researchers.

Method and Results
Using simulated longitudinal treatment data, the authors show how multivariate models extend common univariate growth models and how the multivariate model can be used to examine multivariate hypotheses involving fixed effects (e.g., does the size of the treatment effect differ across outcomes?) and random effects (e.g., is change in one outcome related to change in the other?). An  provides annotated computer code and simulated example data for implementing a multivariate model.

Conclusions
Multivariate multilevel models are flexible, powerful models that can enhance clinical research.},

	abstract = {Mutations in the pore-forming subunit of the {ATP}-sensitive K+ ({KATP}) channel Kir6.2 cause neonatal diabetes. Understanding the molecular mechanism of action of these mutations has provided valuable insight into the relationship between the structure and function of the {KATP} channel. When Kir6.2 containing a mutation (F333I) in the putative {ATP}-binding site is coexpressed with the cardiac type of regulatory {KATP} channel subunit, {SUR}2A, the channel sensitivity to {ATP} inhibition is reduced and the intrinsic open probability (Po) is increased. However, the extent of macroscopic current activation by {MgADP} was unaffected. Here we examine rundown and {MgADP} activation of wild-type and Kir6.2-F333I/{SUR}2A channels using single-channel recording, noise analysis and spectral analysis. We also compare the effect of mutating the adjacent residue, G334, on rundown and {MgADP} activation. All three approaches indicated that rundown of Kir6.2-F333I/{SUR}2A channels is due to a reduction in the number of active channels in the patch and that {MgADP} reactivation involves recruitment of inactive channels. In contrast, rundown and {MgADP} reactivation of wild-type and Kir6.2-G334D/{SUR}2A channels, and of Kir6.2-F333I/{SUR}1 channels, involve a gradual change in Po. Our results suggest that F333 in Kir6.2 interacts functionally with {SUR}2A to modulate channel rundown and {MgADP} activation. This interaction is fairly specific as it is not disturbed when the adjacent residue (G334) is mutated. It is also not a consequence of the enhanced Po of Kir6.2-F333I/{SUR}2A channels, as it is not found for other mutant channels with high Po (Kir6.2-I296L/{SUR}2A).},

	abstract = {Swelling-induced loss of organic osmolytes from cells is mediated by an outwardly rectified, volume-sensitive anion channel termed {VSOAC} (Volume-Sensitive Organic osmolyte/Anion Channel). Similar swelling-activated anion channels have been described in numerous cell types. The unitary conductance and gating kinetics of {VSOAC} have been uncertain, however. Stationary noise analysis and single-channel measurements have produced estimates for the unitary conductance of swelling-activated, outwardly rectified anion channels that vary by \&gt; 15-fold. We used a combination of stationary and nonstationary noise analyses and single-channel measurements to estimate the unitary properties of {VSOAC}. Current noise was analyzed initially by assuming that graded changes in macroscopic current were due to graded changes in channel open probability. Stationary noise analysis predicts that the unitary conductance of {VSOAC} is approximately 1 {pS} at 0 {mV}. In sharp contrast, nonstationary noise analysis demonstrates that {VSOAC} is a 40-50 {pS} channel at +120 {mV} (approximately 15 {pS} at 0 {mV}). Measurement of single-channel events in whole-cell currents and outside-out membrane patches confirmed the nonstationary noise analysis results. The discrepancy between stationary and nonstationary noise analyses and single-channel measurements indicates that swelling-induced current activation is not mediated by a graded increase in channel open probability as assumed initially. Instead, activation of {VSOAC} appears to involve an abrupt switching of single channels from an {OFF} state, where channel open probability is zero, to an {ON} state, where open probability is near unity.},

	abstract = {{CRAC} (calcium release-activated Ca2+) channels attain an extremely high selectivity for Ca2+ from the blockade of monovalent cation permeation by Ca2+ within the pore. In this study we have exploited the blockade by Ca2+ to examine the size of the {CRAC} channel pore, its unitary conductance for monovalent cations, and channel gating properties. The permeation of a series of methylammonium compounds under divalent cation-free conditions indicates a minimum pore diameter of 3.9 Å. Extracellular Ca2+ blocks monovalent flux in a manner consistent with a single intrapore site having an effective Ki of 20 μM at −110 {mV}. Block increases with hyperpolarization, but declines below −100 {mV}, most likely due to permeation of Ca2+. Analysis of monovalent current noise induced by increasing levels of block by extracellular Ca2+ indicates an open probability (Po) of ∼0.8. By extrapolating the variance/mean current ratio to the condition of full blockade (Po = 0), we estimate a unitary conductance of ∼0.7 {pS} for Na+, or three to fourfold higher than previous estimates. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ causes the monovalent current to decline over tens of seconds, a process termed depotentiation. The declining current appears to result from a reduction in the number of active channels without a change in their high open probability. Similarly, low concentrations of 2-{APB} that enhance {ICRAC} increase the number of active channels while open probability remains constant. We conclude that the slow regulation of whole-cell {CRAC} current by store depletion, extracellular Ca2+, and 2-{APB} involves the stepwise recruitment of silent channels to a high open-probability gating mode.},

The resulting membrane current records, filtered at 5 {kHz}, showed record-to-record variations of the current on the order of 1\%. From each set of records the time course of the mean current and the time course of the variance were calculated. 3. The variance was assumed to arise primarily from two independent sources of current fluctuations: the stochastic gating of sodium channels and the thermal noise background in the voltage clamp. Measurement of the passive properties of the nerve preparation allowed the thermal noise variance to be estimated, and these estimates accounted for the variance observed in the presence of tetrodotoxin and at the reversal potential. 4. After the variance σ2 was corrected for the contribution from the background, its relationship to the mean current I could be fitted by the function σ2 = {iI}—I2/N expected for N independent channels having one non-zero conductance level. The single channel currents i corresponded to a single-channel chord conductance γ = 6·4 ± 0·9 {pS} (S.D.; n = 14). No significant difference in γ was observed between the two species of frogs. The size of the total population of channels ranged from 20,000 to 46,000. 5. The voltage dependence of i corresponded closely to the form of the instantaneous current—voltage relationship of the sodium conductance, except at the smallest depolarizations. The small values of i at small depolarizations may have resulted from the filtering of high-frequency components of the fluctuations. 6. It is concluded that sodium channels have only two primary levels of conductance, corresponding to ‘open’ and ‘closed’ states of the channel. 7. The fraction pmax of channels open at the time of the peak conductance was found to be 0·59 ± 0·08 (S.D.; n = 5) and 0·9 ± 0·1 (S.D.; n = 3) for depolarizations to -5 and +125 {mV}, respectively. (50 ms hyperpolarizations to -105 {mV} preceded the depolarizations in each case.) These values are similar to those predicted by Hodgkin-Huxley kinetics. 8. Fluctuations in the firing threshold of neurones are expected from the stochastic gating of sodium channels. A prediction of the size of these fluctuations based on the measured properties of the channels gives a value of about 1\% for the relative spread, which agrees with experimental values in the literature.},

From our study of these fluctuations, we have concluded that the {EIM}-doped bilayer contains ion-conducting channels capable of undergoing transitions between two states of different conductance. The difference in current between the "open" and "closed" states is directly proportional to the applied membrane potential, and corresponds to a conductance of about 3 x 10-10 ohm-1. The fraction of the total number of channels that is open varies from unity to zero as a function of potential. The voltage-dependent opening and closing of channels explains the negative resistance observed for bimolecular lipid membranes treated with greater amounts of {EIM}.},

However, distinct from tossing a coin or a die, the probability of finding the channel closed or open is not a fixed number but can be modified (i.e., we can cheat) by some external stimulus, such as the voltage. Single-channel records can be obtained using the appropriate electrophysiological technique (e.g., patch clamp), and from these records the open probability and the channel conductance can be calculated. Gathering these parameters from a membrane containing many channels is not straightforward, as the macroscopic current I = {iNPo}, where i is the single-channel current, N the number of channels, and Po the probability of finding the channel open, cannot be split into its individual components. In this tutorial, using the probabilistic nature of ion channels, we discuss in detail how i, N, and Po max (the maximum open probability) can be obtained using fluctuation (nonstationary noise) analysis (Sigworth {FJ}. G Gen Physiol 307: 97–129, 1980). We also analyze the sources of possible artifacts in the determination of i and N, such as channel rundown, inadequate filtering, and limited resolution of digital data acquisition by use of a simulation computer program (available at  www.cecs.cl).},

Although single-channel analysis surpasses noise analysis in many instances, there are still regimes, where it cannot be successfully applied for various reasons. In this regard, nonstationary noise analysis retain its value for electrophysiological research in particular, as ever fainter electrical signals are being investigated in biological membranes. To demonstrate the methods, the temperature and pressure dependence of the sodium channel conductance are measured, and in both respects, the sodium channel shows features similar to other ion channels. Both findings are in accord with the physical picture of a rather free ion diffusion through the channel pore which, unlike the channel gating mechanism, does not involve protein rearrangements associated with measurable activation volumes.},

To examine potential errors associated with fluctuation analysis, we simulated ensemble currents and estimated single channel properties. The number (N) and amplitude (i) of the underlying single channels were estimated using nonstationary fluctuation analysis, while mean open time was estimated using covariance and spectral analysis. Both excessive filtering and the analysis of segments of current that were too brief led to underestimates of i and overestimates of N. Setting the low-pass cut-off frequency of the filter to greater than five times the inverse of the effective mean channel open time (burst duration) and analyzing segments of current that were at least 80 times the effective mean channel open time reduced the errors to {\textless} 2\%. With excessive filtering, Butterworth filtering gave up to 10\% less error in estimating i and N than Bessel filtering. Estimates of mean open time obtained from the time constant of decay of the covariance, tau obs, at low open probabilities (Po) were much less sensitive to filtering than estimates of i and N. Extrapolating plots of tau obs versus mean current to the ordinate provided a method to estimate mean open time from data obtained at higher Po, where tau obs no longer represents mean open time. Bessel filtering gave the least error when estimating tau obs from the decay of the covariance function, and Butterworth filtering gave the least error when estimating tau obs from spectral density functions.},

	abstract = {{ATP}-sensitive potassium ({KATP}) channels are composed of four pore-forming Kir6.2 subunits and four regulatory {SUR}1 subunits. Binding of {ATP} to Kir6.2 leads to inhibition of channel activity. Because there are four subunits and thus four {ATP}-binding sites, four binding events are possible. {ATP} binds to both the open and closed states of the channel and produces a decrease in the mean open time, a reduction in the mean burst duration, and an increase in the frequency and duration of the interburst closed states. Here, we investigate the mechanism of interaction of {ATP} with the open state of the channel by analyzing the single-channel kinetics of concatenated Kir6.2 tetramers containing from zero to four mutated Kir6.2 subunits that possess an impaired {ATP}-binding site. We show that the {ATP}-dependent decrease in the mean burst duration is well described by a Monod-Wyman-Changeux model in which channel closing is produced by all four subunits acting in a single concerted step. The data are inconsistent with a Hodgkin-Huxley model (four independent steps) or a dimer model (two independent dimers). When the channel is open, {ATP} binds to a single {ATP}-binding site with a dissociation constant of 300 μM.},

	abstract = {Kir6.2 channels linked to the green fluorescent protein ({GFP}) (Kir6.2-{GFP}) have been expressed alone or with the sulfonylurea receptor {SUR}1 in {HEK}293 cells to study the regulation of {KATP} channels by adenine nucleotides, phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate ({PIP}2), and phosphorylation. Upon excision of inside-out patches into a Ca2+- and {MgATP}-free solution, the activity of Kir6.2-{GFP}+{SUR}1 channels spontaneously ran down, first quickly within a minute, and then more slowly over tens of minutes. In contrast, under the same conditions, the activity of Kir6.2-{GFP} alone exhibited only slow rundown. Thus, fast rundown is specific to Kir6.2-{GFP}+{SUR}1 and involves {SUR}1, while slow rundown is a property of both Kir6.2-{GFP} and Kir6.2-{GFP}+{SUR}1 channels and is due, at least in part, to Kir6.2 alone. Kir6.2-{GFP}+{SUR}1 fast phase of rundown was of variable amplitude and led to increased {ATP} sensitivity. Excising patches into a solution containing {MgADP} prevented this phenomenon, suggesting that fast rundown involves loss of {MgADP}-dependent stimulation conferred by {SUR}1. With both Kir6.2-{GFP} and Kir6.2-{GFP}+{SUR}1, the slow phase of rundown led to further increase in {ATP} sensitivity. Ca2+ accelerated this process, suggesting a role for {PIP}2 hydrolysis mediated by a Ca2+-dependent phospholipase C. {PIP}2 could reactivate channel activity after a brief exposure to Ca2+, but not after prolonged exposure. However, in both cases, {PIP}2 reversed the increase in {ATP} sensitivity, indicating that {PIP}2 lowers the {ATP} sensitivity by increasing Po as well as by decreasing the channel affinity for {ATP}. With Kir6.2-{GFP}+{SUR}1, slow rundown also caused loss of {MgADP} stimulation and sulfonylurea inhibition, suggesting functional uncoupling of {SUR}1 from Kir6.2-{GFP}. Ca2+ facilitated the loss of sensitivity to {MgADP}, and thus uncoupling of the two subunits. The nonselective protein kinase inhibitor H-7 and the selective {PKC} inhibitor peptide 19-36 evoked, within 5–15 min, increased {ATP} sensitivity and loss of reactivation by {PIP}2 and {MgADP}. Phosphorylation of Kir6.2 may thus be required for the channel to remain {PIP}2 responsive, while phosphorylation of Kir6.2 and/or {SUR}1 is required for functional coupling. In summary, short-term regulation of Kir6.2+{SUR}1 channels involves {MgADP}, while long-term regulation requires {PIP}2 and phosphorylation.},

	abstract = {Inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels are gated by the interaction of their cytoplasmic regions with membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate ({PIP}2). In the present study, we examined how {PIP}2 interaction regulates channel availability and channel openings to various subconductance levels (sublevels) as well as the fully open state in the strong inward rectifier Kir2.1 channel. Various Kir2.1 channel constructs were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and single channel or macroscopic currents were recorded from inside-out patches. The wild-type ({WT}) channel rarely visited the subconductance levels under control conditions. However, upon reducing Kir2.1 channel interaction with {PIP}2 by a variety of interventions, including {PIP}2 antibodies, screening {PIP}2 with neomycin, or mutating {PIP}2 binding sites (e.g. K188Q), visitation to the sublevels was markedly increased before channels were converted to an unavailable mode in which they did not open. No channel activity was detected in channels with the double mutation K188A/R189A, a mutant which exhibits extremely weak interaction with {PIP}2. By linking subunits together in tandem dimers or tetramers containing mixtures of {WT} and K188A/R189A subunits, we demonstrate that one functional {PIP}2-interacting {WT} subunit is sufficient to convert channels from the unavailable to the available mode with a high open probability dominated by the fully open state, with similar kinetics as tetrameric {WT} channels. Occasional openings to sublevels become progressively less frequent as the number of {WT} subunits increases. Quantitative analysis reveals that the interaction of {PIP}2 with {WT} subunits exerts strong positive cooperativity in both converting the channels from the unavailable to the available mode, and in promoting the fully open state over sublevels. We conclude that the interaction of {PIP}2 with only one Kir2.1 subunit is sufficient for the channel to become available and to open to its full conductance state. Interaction with additional subunits exerts positive cooperativity at multiple levels to further enhance channel availability and promote the fully open state.},

Typically, 15 ± 7 active channels were found in an excised patch. 3 The distribution of Kir6.2-C-{GFP} protein was investigated by imaging of {GFP} fluorescence. There was a lamellar pattern of fluorescence labelling inside the cytoplasm (presumably associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus) and intense punctate labelling near the cell membrane, but little fluorescence was associated with the plasma membrane. 4 In contrast, cells co-transfected with Kir6.2-C-{GFP} and {SUR}1 exhibited intense uniform plasma membrane labelling, and the lamellar and punctate labelling seen without {SUR}1 was no longer prominent. 5 In cells co-transfected with Kir6.2-C-{GFP} and {SUR}1, strong membrane labelling was associated with very high channel activity, with 484 ± 311 active channels per excised patch. These K+ channels were sensitive to inhibition by {ATP} ({IC}50= 17 μM), stimulated by {ADP} and inhibited by sulphonylureas. 6 We conclude that co-expression of {SUR}1 and Kir6.2 generates channels with the properties of native {KATP} channels.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{ATP}-sensitive potassium (K$_{\textrm{{ATP}}}$) channels are expressed in many excitable, as well as epithelial, cells and couple metabolic changes to modulation of cell activity. {ATP} regulation of K$_{\textrm{{ATP}}}$ channel activity may involve direct binding of this nucleotide to the pore-forming inward rectifier (Kir) subunit despite the lack of known nucleotide-binding motifs. To examine this possibility, we assessed the binding of the fluorescent {ATP} analogue, 2′,3′-\textit{O}-(2,4,6-trinitrophenylcyclo-hexadienylidene)adenosine 5′-triphosphate ({TNP}-{ATP}) to maltose-binding fusion proteins of the {NH}$_{\textrm{2}}$- and {COOH}-terminal cytosolic regions of the three known K$_{\textrm{{ATP}}}$ channels (Kir1.1, Kir6.1, and Kir6.2) as well as to the {COOH}-terminal region of an {ATP}-insensitive inward rectifier K$^{\textrm{+}}$ channel (Kir2.1). We show direct binding of {TNP}-{ATP} to the {COOH} termini of all three known K$_{\textrm{{ATP}}}$ channels but not to the {COOH} terminus of the {ATP}-insensitive channel, Kir2.1. {TNP}-{ATP} binding was specific for the {COOH} termini of K$_{\textrm{{ATP}}}$ channels because this nucleotide did not bind to the {NH}$_{\textrm{2}}$ termini of Kir1.1 or Kir6.1. The affinities for {TNP}-{ATP} binding to K$_{\textrm{{ATP}}}$ {COOH} termini of Kir1.1, Kir6.1, and Kir6.2 were similar. Binding was abolished by denaturing with 4 m urea or {SDS} and enhanced by reduction in {pH}. {TNP}-{ATP} to protein stoichiometries were similar for all K$_{\textrm{{ATP}}}$ {COOH}-terminal proteins with 1 mol of {TNP}-{ATP} binding/mole of protein. Competition of {TNP}-{ATP} binding to the Kir1.1 {COOH} terminus by {MgATP} was complex with both Mg$^{\textrm{2+}}$ and {MgATP} effects. Glutaraldehyde cross-linking demonstrated the multimerization potential of these {COOH} termini, suggesting that these cytosolic segments may directly interact in intact tetrameric channels. Thus, the {COOH} termini of K$_{\textrm{{ATP}}}$tetrameric channels contain the nucleotide-binding pockets of these metabolically regulated channels with four potential nucleotide-binding sites/channel tetramer.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

To determine residues important for {PIP}2 regulation, we have systematically mutated each positive charge in the {COOH} terminus of Kir6.2 to alanine. The effects of these mutations on channel function were examined using 86Rb efflux assays on intact cells and inside-out patch-clamp methods. Both methods identify essentially the same basic residues in two narrow regions (176–222 and 301–314) in the {COOH} terminus that are important for the maintenance of channel function and interaction with {PIP}2. Only one residue (R201A) simultaneously affected {ATP} and {PIP}2 sensitivity, which is consistent with the notion that these ligands, while functionally competitive, are unlikely to bind to identical sites. Strikingly, none of 13 basic residues in the terminal portion (residues 315–390) of the {COOH} terminus affected channel function when neutralized. The data help to define the structural requirements for {PIP}2 sensitivity of {KATP} channels. Moreover, the regions and residues defined in this study parallel those uncovered in recent studies of {PIP}2 sensitivity in other inward rectifier channels, indicating a common structural basis for {PIP}2 regulation.},

Phosphatidylinositol phospholipids, like {PI}(4,5)P2, antagonize nucleotide inhibition of {KATP} channels enhancing the coupling of metabolic events to cell electrical or transport activity. The mechanism by which phospholipids relieve {ATP} block is unclear. We have shown that maltose-binding fusion proteins ({MBP}) containing the {COOH} termini of {KATP} channels (Kir1.1, Kir6.1, and Kir6.2) form functional tetramers that directly bind at least two {ATP} molecules with negative cooperativity. Here we show that purified phosphatidylinositol phospholipids compete for 2,4,6,-trinitrophenyl ({TNP})-{ATP} binding to the {COOH} termini of {KATP} channels with {EC}50 values for {PIP}2 between 6–8 μM. The phospholipid potency profile was {PIP}3 {\textgreater} {PIP}2 = {PIP} {\textgreater} {PI}, suggesting that net phospholipid charge was important. A role for head group charge was supported by polycations (neomycin, spermine, and polylysine) reversing the effect of {PIP}2 on {TNP}-{ATP} binding to the Kir1.1 channel {COOH} terminal fusion protein. In contrast, the water-soluble charged hydrolytic product of {PIP}2, inositol(1,4,5)P3 ({IP}3), had no effect on {TNP}-{ATP} binding, suggesting that the acyl chain of {PIP}2 was also necessary for its effect on {TNP}-{ATP} binding. Indeed, neutral and charged lipids had weak, but significant, effects on {TNP}-{ATP} binding. Whereas μM concentrations of {PIP}2 could compete with {TNP}-{ATP}, we found that {mM} concentrations of {MgATP} were required to compete with {PIP}2 for binding to these {KATP} channel {COOH} termini. Thus the {COOH} termini of {KATP} channels form a nucleotide- and phospholipid-modulated channel gate on which {ATP} and phospholipids compete for binding.},

These channels are heteromultimers composed with a 4:4 stoichiometry of an inwardly rectifying K+ channel subunit (Kir6.2) plus a regulatory sulfonylurea receptor. To elucidate stoichiometry of {ATP}(4-) action, we analyzed {ATP}(4-) sensitivity of channels coassembled from wild-type Kir6.2 and a loss of {ATP}(4-) sensitivity mutant (G334D). Concentration-inhibition curves for {cDNA} ratios of 1:1 or 1:10 resembled those for channel block resulting from interaction with 1 of 4 sites, whereas models for inhibition requiring occupation of 2, 3, or 4 sites were incongruous. Random assembly of wild-type Kir6.2 with the G334D mutant was confirmed by controls, which assessed the effect of an additional mutation that induced strong rectification (N160D). We conclude 4 identical noncooperative {ATP}(4-) sites to be grouped within 1 {KATP} channel complex, with occupation of 1 site being sufficient to induce channel closure. This architecture might facilitate coupling of [{ATP}(4-)] to insulin secretion and may protect against diabetic dysregulation resulting from heterozygous mutations in Kir6.2.},

Binding of {ATP} to Kir6.2 inhibits, whereas interaction of {MgATP} with {SUR}1 activates, {KATP} channels. We tested the functional effects of two Kir6.2 mutations (Y330C, F333I) that cause permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus, by heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes. Both mutations reduced {ATP} inhibition and increased whole-cell currents, which in pancreatic ?-cells is expected to reduce insulin secretion and precipitate diabetes. The Y330C mutation reduced {ATP} inhibition both directly, by impairing {ATP} binding (and/or transduction), and indirectly, by stabilizing the intrinsic open state of the channel. The F333I mutation altered {ATP} binding/transduction directly. Both mutations also altered Kir6.2/{SUR}1 interactions, enhancing the stimulatory effect of {MgATP} (which is mediated via {SUR}1). This effect was particularly dramatic for the Kir6.2-F333I mutation, and was abolished by {SUR}1 mutations that prevent {MgATP} binding/hydrolysis. Further analysis of F333I heterozygous channels indicated that at least three {SUR}1 must bind/hydrolyse {MgATP} to open the mutant {KATP} channel.},

	abstract = {Based initially on their prominence in the squid giant axon, their useful pharmacology, and subsequently on being the first cloned K channels, voltage-gated K (Kv) channels have received the lion's share of attention to their biophysical properties. Kv and Ca-activated K channel kinetics and gating mechanisms have been analyzed, and modeled, in exquisite detail (Hille, 2001). Inward rectifier K (Kir) channels have received less attention, and perusal of the literature indicates that there is still no common understanding of kinetic mechanisms in Kir channels. It is our contention, however, that one is in reach. Amongst Kir channels, {ATP}-sensitive ({KATP}) channels are uniquely regulated by cytoplasmic nucleotides and specific pharmacological agents. As such, they play a critical role in coupling cellular metabolism to electrical activity, and are major drug targets in pancreatic, vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle (Ashcroft, 1988; Nichols and Lederer, 1991). We would argue that these unique properties also permit elucidation of important features of channel gating that are relevant to the whole class of Kir channels. The molecular mechanisms of {KATP} channel regulation have occupied many groups for the last twenty years. Kinetic measurements have led to mathematical models of gating, mutagenesis has indicated relevant molecular elements, and crystallization of various K channel subunits and domains now provides templates for the channel structure. Distilling a consistent model of channel activity and regulation from this broth of data is the challenge for the field, and the topic of this Brief Review.},

	abstract = {{ATP}-sensitive potassium ({KATP}) channels couple cell metabolism to electrical activity by regulating K+ fluxes across the plasma membrane. Channel closure is facilitated by {ATP}, which binds to the pore-forming subunit (Kir6.2). Conversely, channel opening is potentiated by phosphoinositol bisphosphate ({PIP}2), which binds to Kir6.2 and reduces channel inhibition by {ATP}. Here, we use homology modelling and ligand docking to identify the {PIP}2-binding site on Kir6.2. The model is consistent with a large amount of functional data and was further tested by mutagenesis. The fatty acyl tails of {PIP}2 lie within the membrane and the head group extends downwards to interact with residues in the N terminus (K39, N41, R54), transmembrane domains (K67) and C terminus (R176, R177, E179, R301) of Kir6.2. Our model suggests how {PIP}2 increases channel opening and decreases {ATP} binding and channel inhibition. It is likely to be applicable to the {PIP}2-binding site of other Kir channels, as the residues identified are conserved and influence {PIP}2 sensitivity in other Kir channel family members.},

At the single-channel current level, {ATP}-dependent gating transitions between the active burst and the inactive interburst conformations underlie inhibition of the {KATP} channel by intracellular {ATP}. Previously, we identified a slow gating mutation, T171A in the Kir6.2 subunit, which dramatically reduces rates of burst to interburst transitions in Kir6.2{ΔC}26 channels without {SUR}1 in the absence of {ATP}. Here, we constructed all possible mutations at position 171 in Kir6.2{ΔC}26 channels without {SUR}1. Only four substitutions, 171A, 171F, 171H, and 171S, gave rise to functional channels, each increasing Ki,{ATP} for {ATP} inhibition by {\textgreater}55-fold and slowing gating to the interburst by {\textgreater}35-fold. Moreover, we investigated the role of individual Kir6.2 subunits in the gating by comparing burst to interburst transition rates of channels constructed from different combinations of slow 171A and fast T171 “wild-type” subunits. The relationship between gating transition rate and number of slow subunits is exponential, which excludes independent gating models where any one subunit is sufficient for inhibition gating. Rather, our results support mechanisms where four {ATP} sites independently can control a single gate formed by the concerted action of all four Kir6.2 subunit inner helices of the {KATP} channel.},

The inhibitory action of {ATP} is mediated by at least two distinct functional domains within the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of Kir6.2. The G334D mutation of Kir6.2 virtually eliminates {ATP}-dependent gating with no effect on ligand-independent gating, suggesting a role in linkage of the site to the gate or in the {ATP} binding site, itself. The T171A mutation of Kir6.2 strongly disrupts both {ATP}-dependent and ligand-independent gating, suggesting a role for T171 in the gating step. A neighboring mutation, I182Q, virtually eliminates {ATP} inhibition, but its effect on ligand-independent gating remained unknown. We have now characterized both the Ki values for inhibition by {ATP} and the ligand-independent gating kinetics of 15 substitutions at position 182. All substitutions decreased {ATP}-dependent inhibition gating as measured by the Ki, many profoundly so, yet had little or no effect on ligand-independent gating kinetics. Thus, substitutions at position 182 are unlikely to act by disrupting inhibition gate movement. Our results indicate an indispensable role for I182 in a step of the {ATP} binding mechanism, the linkage mechanism coupling the {ATP} binding site to the inhibition gate, or both.},

All of the {KATP} channel mutations examined result in decreased {ATP} inhibition, which in turn is predicted to suppress insulin secretion. Here we describe a patient with severe {PNDM}, which includes developmental delay and epilepsy, in addition to neonatal diabetes (developmental delay, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes [{DEND}]), due to a G334D mutation in the Kir6.2 subunit of {KATP} channel. The patient was wholly unresponsive to sulfonylurea therapy (up to 1.14 mg · kg−1 · day−1) and remained insulin dependent. Consistent with the putative role of G334 as an {ATP}-binding residue, reconstituted homomeric and mixed {WT}+G334D channels exhibit absent or reduced {ATP} sensitivity but normal gating behavior in the absence of {ATP}. In disagreement with the sulfonylurea insensitivity of the affected patient, the G334D mutation has no effect on the sulfonylurea inhibition of reconstituted channels in excised patches. However, in macroscopic rubidium-efflux assays in intact cells, reconstituted mutant channels do exhibit a decreased, but still present, sulfonylurea response. The results demonstrate that {ATP}-binding site mutations can indeed cause {DEND} and suggest the possibility that sulfonylurea insensitivity of such patients may be a secondary reflection of the presence of {DEND} rather than a simple reflection of the underlying molecular basis.},

Metabolically generated changes in the intracellular concentrations of adenosine nucleotides are integral to this regulation, with {ATP} and {ADP} closing the channel and {MgATP} and {MgADP} increasing channel activity. Activating mutations in the genes encoding either of the two types of {KATP} channel subunit (Kir6.2 and {SUR}1) result in neonatal diabetes mellitus, whereas loss-of-function mutations cause hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia of infancy. Sulfonylurea and glinide drugs, which bind to {SUR}1, close the channel through a pathway independent of {ATP} and are now the primary therapy for neonatal diabetes mellitus caused by mutations in the genes encoding {KATP} channel subunits. Insight into the molecular details of drug and nucleotide regulation of channel activity has been illuminated by cryo-electron microscopy structures that reveal the atomic-level organization of the {KATP} channel complex. Here we review how these structures aid our understanding of how the various mutations in the genes encoding Kir6.2 ({KCNJ}11) and {SUR}1 ({ABCC}8) lead to a reduction in {ATP} inhibition and thereby neonatal diabetes mellitus.

We investigated the interactions between {MgATP}, {MgADP}, and the sulphonylurea gliclazide with {KATP} channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. In the absence of {MgATP}, gliclazide block was similar for wild-type channels and those carrying the Kir6.2 {ND} mutations R210C, G334D, I296L, and V59M. Gliclazide abolished the stimulatory effect of {MgATP} on all channels. Conversely, high {MgATP} concentrations reduced the gliclazide concentration, producing a half-maximal block of G334D and R201C channels and suggesting a mutual antagonism between nucleotide and gliclazide binding. The maximal extent of high-affinity gliclazide block of wild-type channels was increased by {MgATP}, but this effect was smaller for {ND} channels; channels that were least sensitive to {ATP} inhibition showed the smallest increase in sulphonylurea block. Consequently, G334D and I296L channels were not fully blocked, even at physiological {MgATP} concentrations (1 mmol/L). Glibenclamide block was also reduced in beta-cells expressing Kir6.2-V59M channels. These data help to explain why patients with some mutations (e.g., G334D, I296L) are insensitive to sulphonylurea therapy, why higher drug concentrations are needed to treat {ND} than type 2 diabetes, and why patients with severe {ND} mutations are less prone to drug-induced hypoglycemia.},

This suggests that linkage between site and gate is conditionally dependent on {ATP} occupancy. We studied all substitutions at position 334 of the {ATP} site in Kir6.2{ΔC}26 that express in Xenopus oocytes. All substitutions disrupted {ATP}-dependent gating by 10-fold or more. Only positive-charged arginine or lysine at 334, however, slowed ligand-independent gating from the burst, and this was in some but not all patches. Moreover, the polycationic peptide protamine reversed the slowed gating from the burst of 334R mutant channels, and speeded the slow gating from the burst of wild-type {SUR}1/Kir6.2 in the absence of {ATP}. Our results support a two-step ligand-dependent linkage mechanism for Kir6.2 channels in which {ATP}-occupied sites function to electrostatically dissociate {COOH}-terminal domains from the membrane, then as in all Kir channels, free {COOH}-terminal domains and inner M2 helices transit to a lower energy state for gate closure.},

	abstract = {A physiological role for long-chain acyl-{CoA} esters to activate {ATP}-sensitive K+ ({KATP}) channels is well established. Circulating palmitate is transported into cells and converted to palmitoyl-{CoA}, which is a substrate for palmitoylation. We found that palmitoyl-{CoA}, but not palmitic acid, activated the channel when applied acutely. We have altered the palmitoylation state by preincubating cells with micromolar concentrations of palmitic acid or by inhibiting protein thioesterases. With acyl-biotin exchange assays we found that Kir6.2, but not sulfonylurea receptor ({SUR})1 or {SUR}2, was palmitoylated. These interventions increased the {KATP} channel mean patch current, increased the open time, and decreased the apparent sensitivity to {ATP} without affecting surface expression. Similar data were obtained in transfected cells, rat insulin-secreting {INS}-1 cells, and isolated cardiac myocytes. Kir6.2{ΔC}36, expressed without {SUR}, was also positively regulated by palmitoylation. Mutagenesis of Kir6.2 Cys166 prevented these effects. Clinical variants in {KCNJ}11 that affect Cys166 had a similar gain-of-function phenotype, but was more pronounced. Molecular modeling studies suggested that palmitoyl-C166 and selected large hydrophobic mutations make direct hydrophobic contact with Kir6.2-bound {PIP}2. Patch-clamp studies confirmed that palmitoylation of Kir6.2 at Cys166 enhanced the {PIP}2 sensitivity of the channel. Physiological relevance is suggested since palmitoylation blunted the regulation of {KATP} channels by α1-adrenoreceptor stimulation. The Cys166 residue is conserved in some other Kir family members (Kir6.1 and Kir3, but not Kir2), which are also subject to regulated palmitoylation, suggesting a general mechanism to control the open state of certain Kir channels.},

Kir6.2 is expressed in muscle, neuron and brain as well as the pancreatic beta-cell, so patients with {KCNJ}11 mutations could have a neurological phenotype in addition to their diabetes. It is proposed that some patients with {KCNJ}11 mutations have neurological features that are part of a discrete neurological syndrome termed developmental Delay, Epilepsy and Neonatal Diabetes ({DEND}), but there are also neurological consequences of chronic or acute diabetes. We identified {KCNJ}11 mutations in four of 10 probands with permanent neonatal diabetes and one affected parent; this included the novel C166F mutation and the previously described V59M and R201H. Four of the five patients with mutations had neurological features: the patient with the C166F mutation had marked developmental delay, severe generalised epilepsy, hypotonia and muscle weakness; mild developmental delay was present in the patient with the V59M mutation; one patient with the R201H mutation had acute and chronic neurological consequences of cerebral oedema and another had diabetic neuropathy from chronic hyperglycaemia. In conclusion, the clinical features in these patients support the existence of a discrete neurological syndrome with {KCNJ}11 mutations. The severe {DEND} syndrome was seen with the novel C166F mutation and mild developmental delay with the V59M mutation.

	abstract = {{KATPchannels} are heteromultimers of a sulfonylurea receptor {SUR} and {KIR}6.2 with the inward rectifier forming the pore which is regulated by {SUR}. We have examined the contributions of the cytoplasmic domains of {KIR}6.2 to control of spontaneous bursting and {ATP}-inhibition in human {SUR}1/{KIR}6.2 {KATPchannels}. Truncations of the N-terminus of {KIR}6.2 nearly eliminate transitions to interburst closed states without affecting the open or intraburst closed states, thus producing {SUR}1/Δ{NKIR}6.2 channels with an extremely high open probability in the absence of nucleotides. These channels have a decrease apparent {ATP}-sensitivity which is consistent with the involvement of the N-terminus in a transition to an interburst closed state that preferentially binds inhibitory {ATP}. Mutations in both the N- and proximal C-termini of {KIR}6.2 can synergistically attenuate the {ATP}-inhibition. The results identify the N-terminus of {KIR}6.2 as a determinant of the interburst kinetics of {KATPchannels} and suggest that the two cytoplasmic domains of {KIR}6.2 participate in {ATP}-inhibitory gating through distinct mechanisms.},

	abstract = {{ATP}-sensitive potassium ({KATP}) channels are reversibly inhibited by intracellular {ATP}. Agents that interact with sulfhydryl moieties produce an irreversible inhibition of {KATP} channel activity when applied to the intracellular membrane surface. {ATP} appears to protect against this effect, suggesting that the cysteine residue with which thiol reagents interact may either lie within the {ATP}-binding site or be inaccessible when the channel is closed. We have examined the interaction of the membrane-impermeant thiol-reactive agent p-chloromercuriphenylsulphonate ({pCMPS}) with the cloned beta cell {KATP} channel. This channel comprises the pore-forming Kir6.2 and regulatory {SUR}1 subunits. We show that the cysteine residue involved in channel inhibition by {pCMPS} resides on the Kir6.2 subunit and is located at position 42, which lies within the {NH}2 terminus of the protein. Although {ATP} protects against the effects of {pCMPS}, the {ATP} sensitivity of the {KATP} channel was unchanged by mutation of C42 to either valine (V) or alanine (A), suggesting that {ATP} does not interact directly with this residue. These results are consistent with the idea that C42 is inaccessible to the intracellular solution, and thereby protected from interaction with {pCMPS} when the channel is closed by {ATP}. We also observed that the C42A mutation does not affect the ability of {SUR}1 to endow Kir6.2 with diazoxide sensitivity, and reduces, but does not prevent, the effects of {MgADP} and tolbutamide, which are mediated via {SUR}1. The Kir6.2-C42A (or V) mutant channel may provide a suitable background for cysteine-scanning mutagenesis studies.},

	abstract = {{ATP}-sensitive potassium ({KATP}) channels are heteromultimeric complexes of an inwardly rectifying Kir channel (Kir6.x) and sulfonylurea receptors. Their regulation by intracellular {ATP} and {ADP} generates electrical signals in response to changes in cellular metabolism. We investigated channel elements that control the kinetics of {ATP}-dependent regulation of {KATP} (Kir6.2 + {SUR}1) channels using rapid concentration jumps. {WT} Kir6.2 channels re-open after rapid washout of {ATP} with a time constant of ∼60 ms. Extending similar kinetic measurements to numerous mutants revealed fairly modest effects on gating kinetics despite significant changes in {ATP} sensitivity and open probability. However, we identified a pair of highly conserved neighboring amino acids (Trp-68 and Lys-170) that control the rate of channel opening and inhibition in response to {ATP}. Paradoxically, mutations of Trp-68 or Lys-170 markedly slow the kinetics of channel opening (500 and 700 ms for W68L and K170N, respectively), while increasing channel open probability. Examining the functional effects of these residues using φ value analysis revealed a steep negative slope. This finding implies that these residues play a role in lowering the transition state energy barrier between open and closed channel states. Using unnatural amino acid incorporation, we demonstrate the requirement for a planar amino acid at Kir6.2 position 68 for normal channel gating, which is potentially necessary to localize the ϵ-amine of Lys-170 in the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-binding site. Overall, our findings identify a discrete pair of highly conserved residues with an essential role for controlling gating kinetics of Kir channels.
Background:
Kir6.2 potassium channels are regulated by {ATP}.
Results:
We measured Kir6.2 gating kinetics in response to rapid {ATP} concentration jumps. Mutations to Trp-68 and Lys-170 dramatically decelerate gating.
Conclusion:
Trp-68 and Lys-170 interact to form a cluster that enables rapid gating transitions.
Significance:
The Trp-68/Lys-170 cluster is highly conserved and may play a similar role in other Kir channels.},

Mutations in the pore-forming subunit (Kir6.2; {KCNJ}11) cause neonatal diabetes, developmental delay, and epilepsy by decreasing sensitivity to {ATP} inhibition and suppressing electrical activity. Mutations of residue G53 underlie both mild (G53R,S) and severe (G53D) forms of the disease. All examined substitutions (G53D,R,S,A,C,F) reduced {ATP}-sensitivity, indicating an intolerance of any amino acid other than glycine. Surprisingly, each mutation reduces {ATP} affinity, rather than intrinsic gating, although structural modeling places G53 at a significant distance from the {ATP}-binding pocket. We propose that glycine is required in this location for flexibility of the distal N-terminus, and for an induced fit of {ATP} at the binding site. Consistent with this hypothesis, glycine substitution of the adjacent residue (Q52G) partially rescues {ATP} affinity of reconstituted Q52G/G53D channels. The results reveal an important feature of the noncanonical {ATP}-sensing mechanism of {KATP} channels.},

We investigated the molecular mechanisms that link ligand binding to the channel gate in {ATP}-sensitive Kir6.2 channels. In these channels, the “slide helix” forms an interface between the cytoplasmic (ligand-binding) domain and the transmembrane pore, and many slide helix mutations cause loss of function. Using a novel approach to rescue electrically silent channels, we decomposed the contribution of each interface residue to {ATP}-dependent gating. We demonstrate that effective inhibition by {ATP} relies on an essential aspartate at residue 58. Characterization of the functional importance of this conserved aspartate, relative to other residues in the slide helix, has been impossible because of loss-of-function of Asp-58 mutant channels. The Asp-58 position exhibits an extremely stringent requirement for aspartate because even a highly conservative mutation to glutamate is insufficient to restore normal channel function. These findings reveal unrecognized slide helix elements that are required for functional channel expression and control of Kir6.2 gating by intracellular {ATP}. Background: Kir6.2 potassium channels are inhibited by intracellular {ATP}. Results: A rescue mechanism was applied to loss-of-function channel mutations. Asp-58 mutations in an interfacial helix (the “slide” helix) abolish {ATP} sensitivity. Conclusion: Residue Asp-58 is essential for coupling Kir6.2 channel cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains.

We studied the closed ⇌ open conformational change at the single-molecule level following perturbation by series of single-site mutations, agonists and membrane voltages.

A truncated isoform of Kir6.2, Kir6.2{ΔC}26, expresses {ATP}-sensitive channels in the absence of {SUR}1, suggesting the {ATP}-inhibitory site lies on the Kir6.2 subunit. 2 We examined the effect on the channel {ATP} sensitivity of mutating the arginine residue at position 50 (R50) in the N-terminus of Kir6.2, by recording macroscopic currents in membrane patches excised from Xenopus oocytes expressing wild-type or mutant Kir6.2{ΔC}26. 3 Substitution of R50 by serine, alanine or glycine reduced the Ki for {ATP} inhibition from 117 μm to 800 μm, 1.1 mm and 3.8 mm, respectively. The single-channel conductance and kinetics were unaffected by any of these mutations. Mutation to glutamate, lysine, asparagine, glutamine or leucine had a smaller effect (Ki, ∼300–400 μm). The results indicate that the side chain of the arginine residue at position 50 is unlikely to contribute directly to the binding site for {ATP}, and suggest it may affect {ATP} inhibition by allosteric interactions. 4 Mutation of the isoleucine residue at position 49 to glycine (I49G) reduced the channel {ATP} sensitivity, while the mutation of the glutamate residue at position 51 to glycine (E51G) did not. 5 When a mutation in the N-terminus of Kir6.2{ΔC}26 that alters {ATP} sensitivity (R50S; Ki, 800 μm) was combined with one in the C-terminus (E179Q; Ki, 300 μm), the Ki for the apparent {ATP} sensitivity was increased to 2.8 mm. The Hill coefficient was also increased. This suggests that the N- and C-termini of Kir6.2 may co-operate to influence channel closure by {ATP}.},

	abstract = {Many ion channels are modulated by multiple stimuli, which allow them to integrate a variety of cellular signals and precisely respond to physiological needs. Understanding how these different signaling pathways interact has been a challenge in part because of the complexity of underlying models. In this study, we analyzed the energetic relationships in polymodal ion channels using linkage principles. We first show that in proteins dually modulated by voltage and ligand, the net free-energy change can be obtained by measuring the charge-voltage (Q-V) relationship in zero ligand condition and the ligand binding curve at highly depolarizing membrane voltages. Next, we show that the voltage-dependent changes in ligand occupancy of the protein can be directly obtained by measuring the Q-V curves at multiple ligand concentrations. When a single reference ligand binding curve is available, this relationship allows us to reconstruct ligand binding curves at different voltages. More significantly, we establish that the shift of the Q-V curve between zero and saturating ligand concentration is a direct estimate of the interaction energy between the ligand- and voltage-dependent pathway. These free-energy relationships were tested by numerical simulations of a detailed gating model of the {BK} channel. Furthermore, as a proof of principle, we estimate the interaction energy between the ligand binding and voltage-dependent pathways for {HCN}2 channels whose ligand binding curves at various voltages are available. These emerging principles will be useful for high-throughput mutagenesis studies aimed at identifying interaction pathways between various regulatory domains in a polymodal ion channel.},

	abstract = {In the {ATP}-dependent K+ ({KATP}) channel pore-forming protein Kir6.2, mutation of three positively charged residues, R50, K185 and R201, impairs the ability of {ATP} to close the channel. The mutations do not change the channel open probability (Po) in the absence of {ATP}, supporting the involvement of these residues in {ATP} binding. We recently proposed that at least two of these positively charged residues, K185 and R201, interact with {ATP} phosphate groups to cause channel closure: the beta phosphate group of {ATP} interacts with K185 to initiate closure, while the α phosphate interacts with R201 to stabilize the channel's closed state. In the present study we replaced these three positive residues with residues of different charge, size and hydropathy. For K185 and R201, we found that charge, more than any other property, controls the interaction of {ATP} with Kir6.2. At these positions, replacement with another positive residue had minor effects on {ATP} sensitivity. In contrast, replacement of K185 with a negative residue (K185D/E) decreased {ATP} sensitivity much more than neutral substitutions, suggesting that an electrostatic interaction between the beta phosphate group of {ATP} and K185 destabilizes the open state of the channel. At R201, replacement with a negative charge (R201E) had multiple effects, decreasing {ATP} sensitivity and preventing full channel closure at high concentrations. In contrast, the R50E mutation had a modest effect on {ATP} sensitivity, and only residues such as proline and glycine that affect protein structure caused major decreases in {ATP} sensitivity at the R50 position. Based on these results and the recently published structure of Kir3.1 cytoplasmic domain, we propose a scheme where binding of the beta phosphate group of {ATP} to K185 induces a motion of the surrounding region, which destabilizes the open state, favouring closure of the M2 gate. Binding of the α phosphate group of {ATP} to R201 then stabilizes the closed state. R50 on the N-terminus controls {ATP} binding by facilitating the interaction of the beta phosphate group of {ATP} with K185 to destabilize the open state.},

Methods A prospective interventional case series of patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration was examined, which received ranibizumab injections until complete resolution of fluid in {SD}-{OCT}. Analysis of changes in subjective perception, Amsler grid, early treatment diabetic retinopathy study ({ETDRS}) {VA}, Radner reading {VA} and fundus examination was conducted in the case of {OCT}-confirmed {CNV} recurrences.
Results Out of 40 morphological recurrences determined by {SD}-{OCT}, six (15\%) were noticed by subjective patient perception. Amsler grid testing revealed deterioration in 12 cases (30\%); 11 recurrences (28\%) were accompanied by loss of ≥5 letters in {ETDRS} {VA} and/or ≥1 line in Radner {VA}; fundus examination showed signs of novel {CNV} activity in 10 out of 40 recurrences (25\%). The combined sensitivity of all diagnostic methods compared to {SD}-{OCT} for recurrence detection was 67.5\% (27 out of 40 recurrences).
Conclusion Subjective patient perception, Amsler grid, {VA} as well as fundus examination lead to pronounced underestimations of {CNV} recurrences. Morphologic recurrences can be detected prior to functional deterioration. As any delay of treatment can result in irreversible vision loss, attempts should be made to provide monthly {OCT} controls to detect recurrences as early as possible.},

	abstract = {The determination of optical coherence tomography ({OCT}) central subfield thickness ({CST}) is an objective measure, and visual acuity ({VA}) is a subjective measure. Therefore, using {OCT} {CST} changes as a surrogate for {VA} changes in diabetic macular edema seems reasonable. However, studies suggest that change in {OCT} {CST} following anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-{VEGF}) treatment for diabetic macular edema is correlated with changes in {VA} but varies substantially among individuals, and so may not be a good surrogate for changes in {VA}.To determine associations between changes in {VA} and changes in {OCT} {CST} across 3 anti-{VEGF} agents (aflibercept, bevacizumab, or ranibizumab) used in a randomized clinical trial for diabetic macular edema.Post hoc analyses were conducted of {DRCR} Retina Network Protocol T among 652 of 660 participants (98.8\%) meeting inclusion criteria for this investigation. The study was conducted between August 22, 2012, and September 23, 2015. The post hoc data collection and analysis were performed from May 29 to July 11, 2018.Six monthly intravitreous anti-{VEGF} injections (unless success was achieved after 3-5 months) were administered; subsequent injections or focal/grid laser photocoagulation treatments were given as needed per protocol to achieve stability.Association between changes in {VA} letter score with changes in {CST} at 12, 52, and 104 weeks after randomization to aflibercept, bevacizumab, or ranibizumab.Of the 652 participants, 304 were women (46.6\%); median age was 61 years (interquartile range, 54-67 years). The correlation between {CST} and {VA} at the follow-up visits was 0.24 (95\% {CI}, 0.16-0.31) in 616 patients at 12 weeks, 0.31 (95\% {CI}, 0.24-0.38) in 609 patients at 52 weeks, and 0.23 (95\% {CI}, 0.15-0.31) in 566 patients at 104 weeks. The correlation coefficients of change in {VA} vs change in {OCT} {CST} for these time intervals were 0.36 (95\% {CI}, 0.29-0.43) at 12 weeks, 0.36 (95\% {CI}, 0.29-0.43) at 52 weeks, and 0.33 (95\% {CI}, 0.26-0.41) at 104 weeks.Changes in {CST} appear to account for only a small proportion of the total variation in changes in {VA}. These findings do not support using changes in {OCT} {CST} as a surrogate for changes in {VA} in phase 3 clinical trials evaluating anti-{VEGF} for diabetic macular edema or as a guide to inform the physician or patient about changes in {VA} after anti-{VEGF} treatment.{ClinicalTrials}.gov identifier: {NCT}01627249},

These channels play crucial roles in many essential physiological processes and have been implicated extensively in a spectrum of metabolic diseases and disorders. To gain insight into the mechanism of {KATP}, we elucidated the structure of a hetero-octameric pancreatic {KATP} channel in complex with a non-competitive inhibitor glibenclamide by single-particle cryoelectron microscopy to 5.6-Å resolution. The structure shows that four {SUR}1 regulatory subunits locate peripherally and dock onto the central Kir6.2 channel tetramer through the {SUR}1 {TMD}0-L0 fragment. Glibenclamide-bound {SUR}1 uses {TMD}0-L0 fragment to stabilize Kir6.2 channel in a closed conformation. In another structural population, a putative co-purified phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate ({PIP}2) molecule uncouples Kir6.2 from glibenclamide-bound {SUR}1. These structural observations suggest a molecular mechanism for {KATP} regulation by anti-diabetic sulfonylurea drugs, intracellular adenosine nucleotide concentrations, and {PIP}2 lipid.},

This issue has been difficult to address because there is no indicator of cytosolic {ATP}, such as those available for Ca2+, capable of resolving the submembrane {ATP} concentration ([{ATP}]sm) in real time within a single cell. We show here that mutant {ATP}-sensitive K+ channels can be used to measure [{ATP}]sm by comparing the increase in current amplitude on patch excision with the {ATP} dose-response curve. In Xenopus oocytes, [{ATP}]sm was 4.6 ± 0.3 mm (n = 29) under resting conditions, slightly higher than that measured for the bulk cytoplasm (2.3 mm). In mammalian ({COSm}6) cells, [{ATP}]smwas slightly lower and averaged 1.4 ± 0.1 mm(n = 66). Metabolic poisoning (10 min of 3 mm azide) produced a significant fall in [{ATP}]sm in both types of cells: to 1.2 ± 0.1 mm (n = 24) in oocytes and 0.8 ± 0.11 mm for {COSm}6 cells. We conclude that [{ATP}]sm lies in the low millimolar range and that there is no gradient between bulk cytosolic and submembrane [{ATP}].},

	abstract = {Inwardly rectifying K+ currents are generated by a complex of four Kir (Kir1–6) subunits. Pore properties are conferred by the second transmembrane domain (M2) of each subunit. Using cadmium ions as a cysteine-interacting probe, we examined the accessibility of substituted cysteines in M2 of the Kir6.2 subunit of inwardly rectifying {KATP} channels. The ability of Cd2+ ions to inhibit channels was used as the estimate of accessibility. The distribution of Cd2+ accessibility is consistent with an α-helical structure of M2. The apparent surface of reactivity is broad, and the most reactive residues correspond to the solvent-accessible residues in the bacterial {KcsA} channel crystal structure. In several mutants, single channel measurements indicated that inhibition occurred by a single transition from the open state to a zero-conductance state. Analysis of currents expressed from mixtures of control and L164C mutant subunits indicated that at least three cysteines are required for coordination of the Cd2+ ion. Application of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate to inside-out membrane patches stabilized the open state of all mutants and also reduced cadmium sensitivity. Moreover, the Cd2+ sensitivity of several mutants was greatly reduced in the presence of inhibitory {ATP} concentrations. Taken together, these results are consistent with state-dependent accessibility of single Cd2+ions to coordination sites within a relatively narrow inner vestibule.},

	abstract = {{ATP}-sensitive K+ channels composed of the pore-forming protein Kir6.2 and the sulphonylurea receptor {SUR}1 are inhibited by {ATP} and activated by Phosphatidylinositol Bisphosphate ({PIP}2). Residues involved in binding of these ligands to the Kir6.2 cytoplasmic domain have been identified, and it has been hypothesized that gating mechanisms involve conformational changes in the regions of the bundle crossing and/or the selectivity filter of Kir6.2. Regulation of Kir6.2 by {SUR}1, however, is not well-understood, even though this process is {ATP} and {PIP}2 dependent. In this study, we investigated the relationship between channel regulation by {SUR}1 and {PIP}2 by comparing a number of single and double mutants known to affect open probability (Po), {PIP}2 affinity, and sulphonylurea and {MgADP} sensitivity. When coexpressed with {SUR}1, the Kir6.2 mutant C166A, which is characterized by a Po value close to 0.8, exhibits no sulphonylurea or {MgADP} sensitivity. However, when Po was reduced by combining mutations at the {PIP}2-sensitive residues R176 and R177 with C166A, sulphonylurea and {MgADP} sensitivities were restored. These effects correlated with a dramatic decrease in {PIP}2 affinity, as assessed by {PIP}2-induced channel reactivation and inhibition by neomycin, an antagonist of {PIP}2 binding. Based on macroscopic and single-channel data, we propose a model in which entry into the high-Po bursting state by the C166A mutation or by {SUR}1 depends on the interaction of {PIP}2 with R176 and R177 and, to a lesser extent, R54. In conjunction with this {PIP}2-dependent process, {SUR}1 also regulates channel activity via a {PIP}2-independent, but {MgADP}-dependent process.},

	abstract = {{ATP}-sensitive potassium channels are under complex regulation by intracellular {ATP} and {ADP}. The potentiating effect of {MgADP} is conferred by the sulfonylurea receptor subunit of the channel, {SUR}, whereas the inhibitory effect of {ATP} appears to be mediated via the pore-forming subunit, Kir6.2. We determined whether {ATP} directly interacts with a binding site on the Kir6.2 subunit to mediate channel inhibition by analyzing binding of a photoaffinity analog of {ATP} (8-azido-[γ-32P]{ATP}) to membranes from {COS}-7 cells transiently expressing Kir6.2. We demonstrate that Kir6.2 can be directly labeled by 8-azido-[γ-32P]{ATP} but that the related subunit Kir4.1, which is not inhibited by {ATP}, is not labeled. Photoaffinity labeling of Kir6.2 is reduced by approximately 50\% with 100 μm {ATP}. In addition, mutations in the {NH}2 terminus (R50G) and the {COOH} terminus (K185Q) of Kir6.2, which have both been shown to reduce the inhibitory effect of {ATP} upon Kir6.2 channel activity, reduced photoaffinity labeling by {\textgreater}50\%.

	abstract = {The {ATP}-sensitive potassium ({KATP}) channel is named after its characteristic inhibition by intracellular {ATP}. The inhibition is a centerpiece of how the {KATP} channel sets electrical signaling to the energy state of the cell. In the beta cell of the endocrine pancreas, for example, {ATP} inhibition results from high blood glucose levels and turns on electrical activity leading to insulin release. The underlying gating mechanism ({ATP} inhibition gating) includes {ATP} stabilization of closed states, but the action of {ATP} on the open state of the channel is disputed. The original models of {ATP} inhibition gating proposed that {ATP} directly binds the open state, whereas recent models indicate a prerequisite transition from the open to a closed state before {ATP} binds and inhibits activity. We tested these two classes of models by using kinetic analysis of single-channel currents from the cloned mouse pancreatic {KATP} channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes. In particular, we combined gating models based on fundamental rate law and burst gating kinetic considerations. The results demonstrate open-state {ATP} dependence as the major mechanism by which {ATP} speeds exit from the active burst state underlying inhibition of the {KATP} channel by {ATP}.},

The “gatekeepers” of the long, {ATP}-inhibited {KIR}6.0 pores of {KATP} channels are {ABC} proteins, {SURs}, receptors for channel opening and closing drugs. Several competing models for {SUR}/{KIR} coupling exist. We show that {SUR} {TMD}0, the N-terminal bundle of five transmembrane helices, specifically associates with {KIR}6.2, forcing nearly silent pores to burst like native {KATP} channels and enhancing surface expression. Inclusion of adjacent submembrane residues of L0, the linker between {TMD}0 and the stimulatory nucleotide- and drug-binding {ABC} core, generates constitutively active channels, whereas additional cytoplasmic residues counterbalance this activation establishing a relationship between the mean open and burst times of intact pores. {SUR} fragments, lacking {TMD}0, fail to modulate {KIR}. {TMD}0 is thus the domain that anchors {SUR} to the {KIR} pore. Consistent with data on chimeric {ABCC}/{KIRs} and a modeled channel structure, we propose that interactions of {TMD}0-L0 with the outer helix and N terminus of {KIR} bidirectionally modulate gating. The results explain and predict pathologies associated with alteration of the 5′ ends of clustered {ABCC}8 (9)/{KCNJ}11 (8) genes.},

The functions of any {TMD}0s are largely unclear. Using Xenopus oocytes to coexpress truncated {SUR} constructs with Kir6, we demonstrated by immunoprecipitation, single-oocyte chemiluminescence and electrophysiological measurements that the {TMD}0 of {SUR}1 strongly associated with Kir6.2 and modulated its trafficking and gating. Two {TMD}0 mutations, A116P and V187D, previously correlated with persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy, were found to disrupt the association between {TMD}0 and Kir6.2. These results underscore the importance of {TMD}0 in {KATP} channel function, explaining how specific mutations within this domain result in disease, and suggest how an {ABC} protein has evolved to regulate a potassium channel.},

	abstract = {{ATP}-sensitive potassium ({KATP}) channels comprise four pore-forming Kir6 and four regulatory sulphonylurea receptor ({SUR}) subunits. {SUR}, an {ATP}-binding cassette protein, associates with Kir6 through its N-terminal transmembrane domain ({TMD}0). {TMD}0 connects to the core domain of {SUR} through a cytosolic linker (L0). The intrinsic gating of Kir6.2 is greatly altered by {SUR}. It has been hypothesized that these changes are conferred by {TMD}0. Exploiting the fact that the pancreatic ({SUR}1/Kir6.2) and the cardiac ({SUR}2A/Kir6.2) {KATP} channels show different gating behaviours, we have tested this hypothesis by comparing the intrinsic gating of Kir6.2 with the last 26 residues deleted (Kir6.2Δ26) co-expressed with {SUR}1, S1-{TMD}0, {SUR}2A and S2-{TMD}0 at −40 and −100 {mV} (S is an abbreviation for {SUR}; {TMD}0/Kir6.2Δ26, but not {TMD}0/Kir6.2, can exit the endoplastic reticulum and reach the cell membrane). Single-channel kinetic analyses revealed that the mean burst and interburst durations are shorter for {TMD}0/Kir6.2Δ26 than for the corresponding {SUR} channels. No differences were found between the two {TMD}0 channels. We further demonstrated that in isolation even {TMD}0-L0 ({SUR} truncated after L0) cannot confer the wild-type intrinsic gating to Kir6.2Δ26 and that swapping L0 ({SUR} truncated after L0)between {SUR}1 and {SUR}2A only partially exchanges their different intrinsic gating. Therefore, in addition to {TMD}0, L0 and the core domain also participate in determining the intrinsic gating of Kir6.2. However, {TMD}0 and L0 are responsible for the different gating patterns of full-length {SUR}1 and {SUR}2A channels. A kinetic model with one open and four closed states is presented to explain our results in a mechanistic context.},

The sensitivity of the channel to different sulfonylureas depends on the {SUR} isoform. In particular, Kir6.2-{SUR}1 but not Kir6.2-{SUR}2A channels are blocked by tolbutamide with high affinity. We made chimeras between {SUR}1 and {SUR}2A to identify the region of the protein involved in high-affinity tolbutamide block. Chimeric {SURs} were coexpressed with Kir6.2 in Xenopus oocytes, and macroscopic currents were measured in inside-out membrane patches. High-affinity tolbutamide inhibition could be conferred on {SUR}2A by replacing transmembrane domains ({TMs}) 14-16 with the corresponding region of {SUR}1. Conversely, high-affinity tolbutamide inhibition of {SUR}1 was abolished by replacing {TMs} 13-16 with the corresponding {SUR}2A sequence, or by mutating a single serine residue within this region to tyrosine (S1237Y). Binding of [3H]glibenclamide to membranes expressing {SUR}1 was abolished concomitantly with the loss of high-affinity tolbutamide block. These results suggest that a site in the {COOH}-terminal set of {TMs} of the {SUR}1 subunit of the K({ATP}) channel is involved in the binding of tolbutamide and glibenclamide.},

We examined the mechanism underlying the tissue specificity of the sulfonylureas tolbutamide and glibenclamide, and the benzamido-derivative meglitinide, using cloned beta-cell (Kir6.2/{SUR}1) and cardiac (Kir6.2/{SUR}2A) K({ATP}) channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Tolbutamide inhibited Kir6.2/{SUR}1 (Ki approximately 5 micromol/l), but not Kir6.2/{SUR}2A, currents with high affinity. Meglitinide produced high-affinity inhibition of both Kir6.2/{SUR}1 and Kir6.2/{SUR}2A currents (Kis approximately 0.3 micromol/l and approximately 0.5 micromol/l, respectively). Glibenclamide also blocked Kir6.2/{SUR}1 and Kir6.2/{SUR}2A currents with high affinity (Kis approximately 4 nmol/l and approximately 27 nmol/l, respectively); however, only for cardiac-type K({ATP}) channels was this block reversible. Physiological concentrations of {MgADP} (100 micromol/l) enhanced glibenclamide inhibition of Kir6.2/{SUR}1 currents but reduced that of Kir6.2/{SUR}2A currents. The results suggest that {SUR}1 may possess separate high-affinity binding sites for sulfonylurea and benzamido groups. {SUR}2A, however, either does not possess a binding site for the sulfonylurea group or is unable to translate the binding at this site into channel inhibition.

{RESEARCH} {DESIGN} {AND} {METHODS}—The effects of L225P on the properties of recombinant {KATP} channels in transfected {COS} cells were assessed by patch-clamp experiments on excised membrane patches and by macroscopic Rb-flux experiments in intact cells.
{RESULTS}—L225P-containing {KATP} channels were significantly more active in the intact cell than in wild-type channels. In excised membrane patches, L225P increased channel sensitivity to stimulatory Mg nucleotides without altering intrinsic gating or channel inhibition by {ATP} in the absence of Mg2+. The effects of L225P were abolished by {SUR}1 mutations that prevent nucleotide hydrolysis at the nucleotide binding folds. L225P did not alter channel inhibition by sulfonylurea drugs, and, consistent with this, the patient responded to treatment with oral sulfonylureas.
{CONCLUSIONS}—L225P underlies {KATP} channel overactivity and {PNDM} by specifically increasing Mg-nucleotide stimulation of the channel, consistent with recent reports of mechanistically similar {PNDM}-causing mutations in {SUR}1. The mutation does not affect sulfonylurea sensitivity, and the patient is successfully treated with sulfonylureas.},

The activity of the {KATP} channel, composed of {SUR}1 and Kir6.2 subunits, is regulated by intracellular {ATP} and {ADP}, but the molecular mechanism is not clear. To distinguish the {ATP} binding properties of the two nucleotide-binding folds ({NBFs}) of {SUR}1, we prepared antibodies against {NBF}1 and {NBF}2, and the tryptic fragment of {SUR}1 was immunoprecipitated after photoaffinity labeling with 8-azido-[32P]{ATP}. The 35-{kDa} fragment was strongly labeled with 5 μm 8-azido-[32P]{ATP} even in the absence of Mg2+ and was immunoprecipitated with the antibody against {NBF}1. The 65-{kDa} fragment labeled with 100 μm 8-azido-[α-32P]{ATP} in the presence of Mg2+ was immunoprecipitated with anti-{NBF}2 and anti-C terminus antibodies. These results indicate that {NBF}1 of {SUR}1 binds 8-azido-{ATP} strongly in a magnesium-independent manner and that {NBF}2 binds 8-azido-{ATP} weakly in a magnesium-dependent manner. Furthermore, the 65-{kDa} tryptic fragment was not photoaffinity-labeled with 8-azido-[γ-32P]{ATP} at 37 °C, whereas the 35-{kDa} tryptic fragment was, suggesting that {NBF}2 of {SUR}1 may have {ATPase} activity and that {NBF}1 has none or little.},

	abstract = {{ATP}-sensitive potassium ({KATP}) channels are regulated by adenine nucleotides to convert changes in cellular metabolic levels into membrane excitability. Hence, elucidation of interaction of {SUR} and Kir6.x with adenine nucleotides is an important issue to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the metabolic regulation of the {KATP} channels. We analyzed direct interactions with adenine nucleotides of each subunit of {KATP} channels. Kir6.2 binds adenine nucleotides in a Mg2+-independent manner. {SUR} has two {NBFs} which are not equivalent: {NBF}1 is a Mg2+-independent high affinity nucleotide binding site, whereas {NBF}2 is a Mg-dependent low affinity site. Although {SUR} has {ATPase} activity at {NBF}2, it is not used to transport substrates against the concentration gradient unlike other {ABC} proteins. The {ATPase} cycle at {NBF}2 serves as a sensor of cellular metabolism. This may explain the low {ATP} hydrolysis rate compared to other {ABC} proteins. Based on studies of photoaffinity labeling, a model of {KATP} channel regulation is proposed, in which {KATP} channel activity is regulated by {SUR} via monitoring the intracellular {MgADP} concentration. {KATP} channel activation is expected to be induced by the cooperative interaction of {ATP} binding at {NBF}1 and {MgADP} binding at {NBF}2.},

	abstract = {{ATP}-sensitive potassium ({KATP}) channels play a key role in mediating glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by coupling metabolic signals to beta-cell membrane potential. Loss of {KATP} channel function due to mutations in {ABCC}8 or {KCNJ}11, genes encoding the sulfonylurea receptor 1 ({SUR}1) or the inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir6.2, respectively, results in congenital hyperinsulinism. Many {SUR}1 mutations prevent trafficking of channel proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface. Channel inhibitors, including sulfonylureas and carbamazepine, have been shown to correct channel trafficking defects. In the present study, we identified 13 novel {SUR}1 mutations that cause channel trafficking defects, the majority of which are amenable to pharmacological rescue by glibenclamide and carbamazepine. By contrast, none of the mutant channels were rescued by {KATP} channel openers. Cross-linking experiments showed that {KATP} channel inhibitors promoted interactions between the N terminus of Kir6.2 and {SUR}1, whereas channel openers did not, suggesting the inhibitors enhance intersubunit interactions to overcome channel biogenesis and trafficking defects. Functional studies of rescued mutant channels indicate that most mutants rescued to the cell surface exhibited {WT}-like sensitivity to {ATP}, {MgADP}, and diazoxide. In intact cells, recovery of channel function upon trafficking rescue by reversible sulfonylureas or carbamazepine was facilitated by the {KATP} channel opener diazoxide. Our study expands the list of {KATP} channel trafficking mutations whose function can be recovered by pharmacological ligands and provides further insight into the structural mechanism by which channel inhibitors correct channel biogenesis and trafficking defects.},

Mutations in the pancreatic {ATP}-sensitive K+ ({KATP}) channel proteins sulfonylurea receptor 1 ({SUR}1) and Kir6.2, encoded by {ABCC}8 and {KCNJ}11, respectively, is the most common cause of the disease. Many mutations in {SUR}1 render the channel unable to traffic to the cell surface, thereby reducing channel function. Previous studies have shown that for some {SUR}1 trafficking mutants, the defects could be corrected by treating cells with sulfonylureas or diazoxide. The purpose of this study is to identify additional mutations that cause channel biogenesis/trafficking defects and those that are amenable to rescue by pharmacological chaperones. Fifteen previously uncharacterized {CHI}-associated missense {SUR}1 mutations were examined for their biogenesis/trafficking defects and responses to pharmacological chaperones, using a combination of immunological and functional assays. Twelve of the 15 mutations analyzed cause reduction in cell surface expression of {KATP} channels by {\textgreater}50\%. Sulfonylureas rescued a subset of the trafficking mutants. By contrast, diazoxide failed to rescue any of the mutants. Strikingly, the mutations rescued by sulfonylureas are all located in the first transmembrane domain of {SUR}1, designated as {TMD}0. All {TMD}0 mutants rescued to the cell surface by the sulfonylurea tolbutamide could be subsequently activated by metabolic inhibition on tolbutamide removal. Our study identifies a group of {CHI}-causing {SUR}1 mutations for which the resulting {KATP} channel trafficking and expression defects may be corrected pharmacologically to restore channel function.},

The assembly pathway is unknown. Pulse-labeling studies show that when K$_{\textrm{{IR}}}$6.2 is expressed individually, its turnover is biphasic; ∼60\% is lost with \textit{t}$_{\textrm{½}}$ ∼36 min. The remainder converts to a long-lived species (\textit{t}$_{\textrm{½}}$ ∼26 h) with an estimated half-time of 1.2 h. Expressed alone, {SUR}1 has a long half-life, ∼25.5 h. When K$_{\textrm{{IR}}}$6.2 and {SUR}1 are co-expressed, they associate rapidly and the fast degradation of K$_{\textrm{{IR}}}$6.2 is eliminated. Based on changes in the glycosylation state of {SUR}1, the half-time for the maturation of K$_{\textrm{{ATP}}}$ channels, including completion of assembly, transit to the Golgi, and glycosylation, is ∼2.2 h. Estimation of the turnover rates of mature, fully glycosylated {SUR}1 associated with K$_{\textrm{{IR}}}$6.2 and of K$_{\textrm{{IR}}}$6.2 associated with Myc-tagged {SUR}1 gave similar values for the half-life of K$_{\textrm{{ATP}}}$ channels, a mean value of ∼7.3 h. K$_{\textrm{{ATP}}}$ channel subunits in {INS}-1 beta-cells displayed qualitatively similar kinetics. The results imply the octameric channels are stable. Two mutations, K$_{\textrm{{IR}}}$6.2 W91R and {SUR}1 ΔF1388, identified in patients with the severe form of familial hyperinsulinism, profoundly alter the rate of K$_{\textrm{{IR}}}$6.2 and {SUR}1 turnover, respectively. Both mutant subunits associate with their respective partners but dissociate freely and degrade rapidly. The data support models of channel formation in which K$_{\textrm{{IR}}}$6.2-{SUR}1 heteromers assemble functional channels and are inconsistent with models where {SUR}1 can only assemble with K$_{\textrm{{IR}}}$6.2 tetramers.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Hyperinsulinism of infancy is a genetically heterogeneous disease characterized by dysregulation of insulin secretion resulting in severe hypoglycemia. To date, mutations in five different genes, the sulfonylurea receptor ({SUR}1, {ABCC}8), the inward rectifying potassium channel ({KIR}6.2, {KCNJ}11), glucokinase ({GCK}), glutamate dehydrogenase ({GLUD}1), and short-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase ({SCHAD}), have been implicated. Previous reports suggest that, in 40\% of patients, no mutation can be identified in any of these genes, suggesting additional locus heterogeneity. However, previous studies did not screen all five genes using direct sequencing, the most sensitive technique available for mutation detection. We selected 15 hyperinsulinism of infancy patients and systematically sequenced the promoter and all coding exons and intron/exon boundaries of {ABCC}8 and {KCNJ}11. If no mutation was identified, the coding sequence and intron/exon boundaries of {GCK}, {GLUD}1, and {SCHAD} were sequenced. Seven novel mutations were found in the {ABCC}8 coding region, one mutation was found in the {KCNJ}11 coding region, and one novel mutation was found in each of the two promoter regions screened. Functional studies on beta-cells from six patients showed abnormal {ATP}-sensitive K+ channel function in five of the patients; the sixth had normal channel activity, and no mutations were found. Photolabeling studies using a reconstituted system showed that all missense mutations altered intracellular trafficking. Each of the promoter mutations decreased expression of a reporter gene by about 60\% in a heterologous expression system. In four patients (27\%), no mutations were identified. Thus, further genetic heterogeneity is suggested in this disorder. These patients represent a cohort that can be used for searching for mutations in other candidate genes.},

In pancreatic beta-cells, {KATP} channels play a key role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and gain or loss of channel function results in neonatal diabetes or congenital hyperinsulinism, respectively. The beta-cell {KATP} channel is formed by co-assembly of four Kir6.2 inwardly rectifying potassium channel subunits encoded by {KCNJ}11 and four sulfonylurea receptor 1 subunits encoded by {ABCC}8. Many mutations in {ABCC}8 or {KCNJ}11 cause loss of channel function, thus congenital hyperinsulinism by hampering channel biogenesis and hence trafficking to the cell surface. The trafficking defects caused by a subset of these mutations can be corrected by sulfonylureas, {KATP} channel antagonists that have long been used to treat type 2 diabetes. More recently, carbamazepine, an anticonvulsant that is thought to target primarily voltage-gated sodium channels has been shown to correct {KATP} channel trafficking defects. This article reviews studies to date aimed at understanding the mechanisms by which mutations impair channel biogenesis and trafficking and the mechanisms by which pharmacological ligands overcome channel trafficking defects. Insight into channel structure-function relationship and therapeutic implications from these studies are discussed.},

Despite medical treatment, the newborn continued to suffer from severe hypoglycemic episodes, and at 4 months of age subtotal pancreatectomy was performed.Main Outcome Measure: We assessed patch-clamp recordings and confocal microscopy in {HEK}293T cells.Results: We have identified a homozygous missense mutation, H259R, in the Kir6.2 subunit of a patient with severe {CHI}. Coexpression of Kir6.2H259R with sulfonylurea receptor 1 in {HEK}293T cells completely abolished {KATP} currents in electrophysiological recordings. Double immunofluorescence staining revealed that mutant Kir6.2 was partly retained in the endoplasmic reticulum ({ER}) causing decreased surface expression as observed with total internal reflection fluorescence. Mutation of an {ER}-retention signal partially rescued the trafficking defect without restoring whole-cell currents.Conclusion: The H259R mutation of the Kir6.2 subunit results in a channel that is partially retained in the {ER} and nonfunctional upon arrival at the plasma membrane.},

The channel couples metabolism to membrane electrical events bringing about insulin secretion. Given the critical role of this channel in glucose homeostasis it is therefore not surprising that mutations in the genes encoding for the two essential subunits of the channel can result in both hypo- and hyperglycemia. The channel consists of four subunits of the inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir6.2 and four subunits of the sulfonylurea receptor 1 ({SUR}1). It has been known for some time that loss of function mutations in {KCNJ}11, which encodes for Kir6.2, and {ABCC}8, which encodes for {SUR}1, can cause oversecretion of insulin and result in hyperinsulinism of infancy, while activating mutations in {KCNJ}11 and {ABCC}8 have recently been described that result in the opposite phenotype of diabetes. This review focuses on reported mutations in both genes, the spectrum of phenotypes, and the implications for treatment on diagnosing patients with mutations in these genes.

Loss of functional {KATP} channels because of mutations in either the {SUR}1 or Kir6.2 channel subunit causes persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy ({PHHI}). We investigated the molecular mechanism by which a single phenylalanine deletion in {SUR}1 (ΔF1388) causes {PHHI}. Previous studies have shown that coexpression of ΔF1388 {SUR}1 with Kir6.2 results in no channel activity. We demonstrate here that the lack of functional expression is due to failure of the mutant channel to traffic to the cell surface. Trafficking of {KATP} channels requires that the endoplasmic reticulum-retention signal, {RKR}, present in both {SUR}1 and Kir6.2, be shielded during channel assembly. To ask whether ΔF1388 {SUR}1 forms functional channels with Kir6.2, we inactivated the {RKR} signal in ΔF1388 {SUR}1 by mutation to {AAA} (ΔF1388 {SUR}1AAA). Inactivation of similar endoplasmic reticulum-retention signals in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator has been shown to partially overcome the trafficking defect of a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator mutation, ΔF508. We found that coexpression of ΔF1388 {SUR}1AAA with Kir6.2 led to partial surface expression of the mutant channel. Moreover, mutant channels were active. Compared with wild-type channels, the mutant channels have reduced {ATP} sensitivity and do not respond to stimulation by {MgADP} or diazoxide. The {RKR} → {AAA} mutation alone has no effect on channel properties. Our results establish defective trafficking of {KATP} channels as a molecular basis of {PHHI} and show that F1388 in {SUR}1 is critical for normal trafficking and function of {KATP} channels.},

Heterozygous activating mutations in the {KCNJ}11 gene encoding Kir6.2, the pore-forming subunit of the {ATP}-sensitive potassium ({KATP}) channel, are the most common cause of permanent neonatal diabetes. The sulphonylurea receptor ({SUR}) {SUR}1 serves as the regulatory subunit of the {KATP} channel in pancreatic beta cells. We therefore hypothesized that activating mutations in the {ABCC}8 gene, which encodes {SUR}1, might cause neonatal diabetes. We identified a novel heterozygous mutation, F132L, in the {ABCC}8 gene of a patient with severe developmental delay, epilepsy and neonatal diabetes ({DEND} syndrome). This mutation had arisen de novo and was not present in 150 control chromosomes. Residue F132 shows evolutionary conservation across species and is located in the first set of transmembrane helices ({TMD}0) of {SUR}1, which is proposed to interact with Kir6.2. Functional studies of recombinant {KATP} channels demonstrated that F132L markedly reduces the sensitivity of the {KATP} channel to inhibition by {MgATP} and this increases the whole-cell {KATP} current. The functional consequence of this {ABCC}8 mutation mirrors that of {KCNJ}11 mutations causing neonatal diabetes and provides new insights into the interaction of Kir6.2 and {SUR}1. As {SUR}1 is expressed in neurones as well as in beta cells, this mutation can account for both neonatal diabetes and the neurological phenotype. Our results demonstrate that {SUR}1 mutations constitute a new genetic aetiology for neonatal diabetes and that they act by reducing the {KATP} channel's {ATP} sensitivity.},

	abstract = {Congenital hyperinsulinism ({CHI}), characterized by profound hypoglycaemia related to inappropriate insulin secretion, may be associated histologically with either diffuse insulin hypersecretion or focal adenomatous hyperplasia, which share a similar clinical presentation, but result from different molecular mechanisms. Whereas diffuse {CHI} is of autosomal recessive, or less frequently of autosomal dominant, inheritance, focal {CHI} is sporadic. The most common mechanism underlying {CHI} is dysfunction of the pancreatic {ATP}-sensitive potassium channel (K$^{\textrm{+}}$$_{\textrm{{ATP}}}$). The two subunits of the K$^{\textrm{+}}$$_{\textrm{{ATP}}}$ channel are encoded by the sulfonylurea receptor gene \textit{({SUR}1} or \textit{{ABCC}8)} and the inward-rectifying potassium channel gene \textit{({KIR}6.2} or \textit{{KCNJ}11)}, both located in the 11p15.1 region. Germ-line, paternally inherited, mutations of the \textit{{SUR}1} or \textit{{KIR}6.2} genes, together with somatic maternal haplo-insufficiency for 11p15.5, were shown to result in focal {CHI}. Diffuse {CHI} results from germ-line mutations in the \textit{{SUR}1} or \textit{{KIR}6.2} genes, but also from mutations in several other genes, namely glutamate dehydrogenase (with associated hyperammonaemia), glucokinase, short-chain L-3-hydroxyacyl-{CoA} dehydrogenase, and insulin receptor gene. Hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia may be observed in several overlapping syndromes, such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome ({BWS}), Perlman syndrome, and, more rarely, Sotos syndrome. Mosaic genome-wide paternal isodisomy has recently been reported in patients with clinical signs of {BWS} and {CHI}. The primary causes of {CHI} are genetically heterogeneous and have not yet been completely unveiled. However, secondary causes of hyperinsulinism have to be considered such as fatty acid oxidation deficiency, congenital disorders of glycosylation and factitious hypoglycaemia secondary to Munchausen by proxy syndrome.},

It is closed by glucose metabolism, which stimulates insulin secretion, and opened by the drug diazoxide, which inhibits insulin release. Metabolic regulation is mediated by changes in {ATP} and Mg-{ADP}, which inhibit and potentiate channel activity, respectively. The ?-cell K-{ATP} channel consists of a pore-forming subunit, Kir6.2, and a regulatory subunit, {SUR}1. We have mutated (independently or together) two lysine residues in the Walker A ({WA}) motifs of the first (K719A) and second (K1384M) nucleotide-binding domains ({NBDs}) of {SUR}1. These mutations are expected to inhibit nucleotide hydrolysis. Our results indicate that the {WA} lysine of {NBD}1 (but not {NBD}2) is essential for activation of K-{ATP} currents by diazoxide. The potentiatory effects of Mg-{ADP} required the presence of the {WA} lysines in both {NBDs}. Mutant currents were slightly more sensitive to {ATP} than wild-type currents. Metabolic inhibition led to activation of wild-type and K1384M currents, but not K719A or K719A/K1384M currents, suggesting that there may be a factor in addition to {ATP} and {ADP} which regulates K-{ATP} channel activity.},

We propose a model in which {SUR}1 sensitizes the {KATP} channel to {ATP} inhibition, and nucleotide hydrolysis at the nucleotide binding folds blocks this effect. {MgADP} and diazoxide are proposed to stabilize this desensitized state of the channel, and mutations at the nucleotide binding folds alter the response of channels to {MgADP} and diazoxide by altering nucleotide hydrolysis rates or the coupling of hydrolysis to channel activation.},

Mutations in {SUR} have been identified in individuals affected with familial persistent hyper-insulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy ({PHHI}), an autosomal recessive disorder of glucose metabolism which is linked to chromosome 11p15.1 and characterized by unregulated secretion of insulin and profound hypo-glycemia. Because the Kir6.2 locus is within 5 kilobases (kb) of the {SUR} gene on chromosome 11p15.1 and it is a necessary member of the beta-cell {KATP} channel, we considered Kir6.2 as a candidate gene for {PHHI}. We identified a homozygous point mutation in Kir6.2 in the genomic {DNA} of a child, severely affected with {PHHI}, from a consanguineous family. This mutation is predicted to disrupt the conservedα-helical second transmembrane (M2) domain of the inward rectifier by substitution of a proline for a leucine residue (L147P). Mutation of Kir6.2, like {SUR}, appears to lead to the {PHHI} phenotype suggesting that Kir6.2 is necessary, although not sufficient, for normal regulation of insulin release.},

Side by side comparison of single-channel kinetics and steady-state {ATP} inhibition of human beta-cell, {SUR}1/{KIR}6.2,versus cardiac, {SUR}2A/{KIR}6.2 channels demonstrate that the latter have a greater mean burst duration and open probability in the absence of nucleotides and ∼4-fold higher {IC}50({ATP}). We have used matched chimeras of {SUR}1 and {SUR}2A to show that the kinetics, which determine the maximal open probability (Pomax), and the {ATP} sensitivity are functionally separable and to identify the two segments of {SUR} responsible for these isoform differences. A region within the first five transmembrane domains specifies the interburst kinetics, whereas a C-terminal segment determines the sensitivity to inhibitory {ATP}. The separable effects of {SUR} on {ATP} inhibition and channel kinetics implies that the cytoplasmic C terminus of {SUR} either directly modulates the affinity of a weak {ATP} binding site on the inward rectifier or affects linkage between the binding site and the gate. This is the first identification of parts of an {ABC} protein that interact with an ion channel subunit to modulate the spontaneous activity and {ATP} sensitivity of the heteromeric channel.},

Micromolar Ntp dose-dependently increased the mean open channel probability in ligand-free solution (P O(max)) and attenuated the {ATP} inhibition of {KIR}6.2/{SUR}1, but had no effect on homomeric {KIR}6.2 channels. Ntp (up to ∼10−4m) did not affect significantly the mean open or “fast,” K+ driving force-dependent, intraburst closed times, verifying that Ntp selectively modulates the ratio of mean burst to interburst times. Ctp and Rnp, a randomized Ntp, had no effect, indicating that the effects of Ntp are structure specific. Ntp opened {KIR}6.1/{SUR}1 channels normally silent in the absence of stimulatory Mg− nucleotide(s) and attenuated the coupling of high-affinity sulfonylurea binding with {KATP} pore closure. These effects resemble those seen with N-terminal deletions (ΔN) of {KIR}6.0, and application of Ntp to Δ{NKATP} channels decreased {theirP} O(max) and apparent {IC}50 for {ATP} in the absence of Mg2+. The results are consistent with a competition between Ntp and the endogenous N terminus for a site of interaction on the cytoplasmic face of the channel or with partial replacement of the deleted N terminus by Ntp, respectively. The {KIR} N terminus and the {TMD}0-L0 segment of {SUR}1 are known to control the P O(max). The L0 linker has been reported to be required for glibenclamide binding, and Δ{NKIR}6.2/{SUR}1 channels exhibit reduced labeling of {KIR} with 125I-azidoglibenclamide, implying that the {KIR} N terminus and L0 of {SUR}1 are in proximity.

Trafficking defects resulting from three independent {SUR}1 mutations involved in the disease persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy have been described. Two of these mutations displayed notable decreases in glycosylation. Here we have investigated the relationship between the two N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn10 and Asn1050) and {SUR}1 trafficking. Using patch clamp analysis, surface biotinylation, and immunofluorescence microscopy, we demonstrate a significant decrease in surface expression of {SUR}1 single or double glycosylation site mutants (N10Q,N1050Q) when co-expressed with Kir6.2. Additionally, we show prominent retention within the {ER} of the {SUR}1 double glycosylation mutant under the same conditions. Further investigation revealed that mutation of the {ER} retention signal was able to partially restore surface expression of the {SUR}1 double glycosylation mutant. These studies suggest that {SUR}1 glycosylation is a key element for the proper trafficking and surface expression of {KATP} channels.},

	abstract = {{ATP}-sensitive potassium ({KATP}) channels of pancreatic beta-cells mediate glucose-induced insulin secretion by linking glucose metabolism to membrane excitability. The number of plasma membrane {KATP} channels determines the sensitivity of beta-cells to glucose stimulation. The {KATP} channel is formed in the endoplasmic reticulum ({ER}) on coassembly of four inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir6.2 subunits and four sulfonylurea receptor 1 ({SUR}1) subunits. Little is known about the cellular events that govern the channel's biogenesis efficiency and expression. Recent studies have implicated the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in modulating surface expression of several ion channels. In this work, we investigated whether the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays a role in the biogenesis efficiency and surface expression of {KATP} channels. We provide evidence that, when expressed in {COS} cells, both Kir6.2 and {SUR}1 undergo {ER}-associated degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Moreover, treatment of cells with proteasome inhibitors {MG}132 or lactacystin leads to increased surface expression of {KATP} channels by increasing the efficiency of channel biogenesis. Importantly, inhibition of proteasome function in a pancreatic beta-cell line, {INS}-1, that express endogenous {KATP} channels also results in increased channel number at the cell surface, as assessed by surface biotinylation and whole cell patch-clamp recordings. Our results support a role of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in the biogenesis efficiency and surface expression of beta-cell {KATP} channels.},

In this article, we discuss recent developments that reveal the involvement of ubiquitin in the degradation of proteins retained within the endoplasmic reticulum ({ER}) and in the internalization of plasma membrane proteins. Both luminal and transmembrane proteins retained in the {ER} are now known to be retrotranslocated into the cytosol in a process that involves {ER} chaperones and components of the protein import machinery. Once exposed to the cytosolic milieu, retro-translocated proteins are degraded by the proteasome, in most cases following polyubiquitination. There is growing evidence that both the ubiquitin-conjugating machinery and proteasomes may be associated with the cytosolic face of the {ER} membrane and that they could be functionally coupled to the process of retro-translocation. The ubiquitination of plasma membrane proteins, on the other hand, mediates internalization of the proteins, which in most cases is followed by lysosomal/vacuolar degradation. There is, however, a well-documented case of a plasma membrane protein (the c-Met receptor) for which ubiquitination results in proteasomal degradation. These recent findings imply that ubiquitin plays more diverse roles in the regulation of the fate of cellular proteins than originally anticipated.},

Thus, the N-terminal deletion does not alter the intrinsic properties of Kir6.2. 4 When Kir6.2{ΔN}14 was coexpressed with {SUR}1, the resulting {KATP} channels had a higher open probability (Po= 0·7) and a lower {ATP} sensitivity (Ki= 196 μM) than wild-type (Kir6.2/{SUR}1) channels (Po= 0·32, Ki= 28 μM). High-affinity tolbutamide block was also abolished. 5 Truncation of five or nine amino acids from the N-terminus of Kir6.2 also enhanced the open probability, and reduced both the {ATP} sensitivity and the fraction of high-affinity tolbutamide block, although to a lesser extent than for the ΔN14 deletion. Site-directed mutagenesis suggests that hydrophobic residues in Kir6.2 may be involved in this effect. 6 The reduced {ATP} sensitivity of Kir6.2{ΔN}14 may be explained by the increased Po. However, when the Po was decreased (by {ATP}), tolbutamide was unable to block Kir6.2{ΔN}14/{SUR}1-K719A,K1385M currents, despite the fact that the drug inhibited Kir6.2-C166S/{SUR}1-K719A,K1385M currents (which in the absence of {ATP} have a Po of {\textgreater} 0·8 and are not blocked by tolbutamide).

Quantitative immunofluorescence and cell surface biotinylation supports the idea that there is little disturbance in the efficiency of trafficking. Our data show that deletions of the C-terminal most cytoplasmic domain of {SUR}1, can result in functional channels at the plasma membrane in mammalian cells that have an abnormal response to physiological and pharmacological agents.},

	abstract = {Key points beta-Cell {KATP} channels are partially open in the absence of metabolic substrates, whereas cardiac {KATP} channels are closed. Using cloned channels heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes we measured the effect of {MgADP} on the {MgATP} concentration–inhibition curve immediately after patch excision. {MgADP} caused a far more striking reduction in {ATP} inhibition of Kir6.2/{SUR}1 channels than Kir6.2/{SUR}2A channels; this effect declined rapidly after patch excision. Exchanging the final 42 amino acids of {SUR} was sufficient to switch the Mg-nucleotide regulation of Kir6.2/{SUR}1 and Kir6.2/{SUR}2A channels, and partially switch their sensitivity to metabolic inhibition. Deletion of the C-terminal 42 residues of {SUR} abolished {MgADP} activation of both Kir6.2/{SUR}1 and Kir6.2/{SUR}2A channels. We conclude that the different metabolic sensitivity of Kir6.2/{SUR}1 and Kir6.2/{SUR}2A channels is at least partially due to their different regulation by Mg-nucleotides, which is determined by the final 42 amino acids. Abstract {ATP}-sensitive potassium ({KATP}) channels couple the metabolic state of a cell to its electrical activity and play important physiological roles in many tissues. In contrast to beta-cell (Kir6.2/{SUR}1) channels, which open when extracellular glucose levels fall, cardiac (Kir6.2/{SUR}2A) channels remain closed. This is due to differences in the {SUR} subunit rather than cell metabolism. As {ATP} inhibition and {MgADP} activation are similar for both types of channels, we investigated channel inhibition by {MgATP} in the presence of 100 μm {MgADP} immediately after patch excision [when the channel open probability ({PO}) is near maximal]. The results were strikingly different: 100 μm {MgADP} substantially reduced {MgATP} inhibition of Kir6.2/{SUR}1, but had no effect on {MgATP} inhibition of Kir6.2/{SUR}2A. Exchanging the final 42 residues of {SUR}2A with that of {SUR}1 switched the channel phenotype (and vice versa), and deleting this region abolished Mg-nucleotide activation. This suggests the C-terminal 42 residues are important for the ability of {MgADP} to influence {ATP} inhibition at Kir6.2. This region was also necessary, but not sufficient, for activation of the {KATP} channel in intact cells by metabolic inhibition (azide). We conclude that the ability of {MgADP} to impair {ATP} inhibition at Kir6.2 accounts, in part, for the differential metabolic sensitivities of beta-cell and cardiac {KATP} channels.},

	abstract = {{ATP}-sensitive potassium ({KATP}) channels mediate glucose-induced insulin secretion by coupling metabolic signals to beta-cell membrane potential and the secretory machinery. Reduced {KATP} channel expression caused by mutations in the channel proteins: sulfonylurea receptor 1 ({SUR}1) and Kir6.2, results in loss of channel function as seen in congenital hyperinsulinism. Previously, we reported that sulfonylureas, oral hypoglycemic drugs widely used to treat type {II} diabetes, correct the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane trafficking defect caused by two {SUR}1 mutations, A116P and V187D. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which sulfonylureas rescue these mutants. We found that glinides, another class of {SUR}-binding hypoglycemic drugs, also markedly increased surface expression of the trafficking mutants. Attenuating or abolishing the ability of mutant {SUR}1 to bind sulfonylureas or glinides by the following mutations: Y230A, S1238Y, or both, accordingly diminished the rescuing effects of the drugs. Interestingly, rescue of the trafficking defects requires mutant {SUR}1 to be co-expressed with Kir6.2, suggesting that the channel complex, rather than {SUR}1 alone, is the drug target. Observations that sulfonylureas also reverse trafficking defects caused by neonatal diabetes-associated Kir6.2 mutations in a way that is dependent on intact sulfonylurea binding sites in {SUR}1 further support this notion. Our results provide insight into the mechanistic and structural basis on which sulfonylureas rescue {KATP} channel surface expression defects caused by channel mutations.},

However, the precise kinetic properties of Kir6.2/{SUR}1 clones remain unknown. Herein, intraburst kinetics of Kir6.2/{SUR}1 channel activity, heterologously co-expressed in {COS} cells, displayed mean closed times from 0.7 ± 0.1 to 0.4 ± 0.03 msec, and from 0.4 ± 0.1 to 2.0 ± 0.2 msec, and mean open times from 1.9 ± 0.4 to 4.5 ± 0.8 msec, and from 12.1 ± 2.4 to 5.0 ± 0.2 msec between −100 and −20 {mV}, and +20 to +80 {mV}, respectively. Burst duration for Kir6.2/{SUR}1 activity was 17.9 ± 1.8 msec with 5.6 ± 1.5 closings per burst. Burst kinetics of the Kir6.2/{SUR}1 activity could be fitted by a four-state kinetic model defining transitions between one open and three closed states with forward and backward rate constants of 1905 ± 77 and 322 ± 27 sec−1 for intraburst, 61.8 ± 6.6 and 23.9 ± 5.8 sec−1 for interburst, 12.4 ± 6.0 and 13.6 ± 2.9 sec−1 for intercluster events, respectively. Intraburst kinetic properties of Kir6.2/{SUR}1 clones were essentially indistinguishable from pancreatic or cardiac {KATP} channel phenotypes, indicating that intraburst kinetics per se were insufficient to classify recombinant Kir6.2/{SUR}1 amongst native {KATP} channels. Yet, burst kinetic behavior of Kir6.2/{SUR}1 although similar to pancreatic, was different from that of cardiac {KATP} channels. Thus, expression of Kir6.2/{SUR}1 proteins away from the pancreatic micro-environment, confers the burst kinetic identity of pancreatic, but not cardiac {KATP} channels. This study reports the kinetic properties of Kir6.2/{SUR}1 clones which could serve in the further characterization of novel {KATP} channel clones.},

In this study, we determined the direct effects of {EETs} on the binding of {ATP} to {KATP} channel protein. A fluorescent {ATP} analog, 2,4,6-trinitrophenyl ({TNP})-{ATP}, which increases its fluorescence emission significantly upon binding with proteins, was used for binding studies with glutathione-S-transferase ({GST}) Kir6.2 fusion proteins. {TNP}-{ATP} bound to {GST} fusion protein containing the C-terminus of Kir6.2 ({GST}-Kir6.2C), but not to the N-terminus of Kir6.2, or to {GST} alone. 11,12-{EET} (5 μM) did not change {TNP}-{ATP} binding {KD} to {GST}-Kir6.2C, but Bmax was reduced by half. The effect of 11,12-{EET} was dose-dependent, and 8,9- and 14,15-{EETs} were as effective as 11,12-{EET} in inhibiting {TNP}-{ATP} binding to {GST}-Kir6.2C. {AA} and 11,12-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (11,12-{DHET}), the parent compound and metabolite of 11,12-{EET}, respectively, were not effective inhibitors of {TNP}-{ATP} binding to {GST}-Kir6.2C, whereas the methyl ester of 11,12-{EET} was. These findings suggest that the epoxide group in {EETs} is important for modulation of {ATP} binding to Kir6.2.

The openings of the channels appeared in bursts. Gating kinetics within the bursts were investigated. It was shown that the channel mean open (τo) and closed (τc) times during a burst depended primarily on the electromotive force (V-Vk) for potassium ions. For different [K+]o, τo was maximal and τc was minimal in the region of reversal potentials (Vrev); τo decreased and τc increased gradually with deviation {ofV} {fromVrev}.

	abstract = {The {ATP}-sensitive potassium ({KATP}) channel exhibits spontaneous bursts of rapid openings, which are separated by long closed intervals. Previous studies have shown that mutations at the internal mouth of the pore-forming (Kir6.2) subunit of this channel affect the burst duration and the long interburst closings, but do not alter the fast intraburst kinetics. In this study, we have investigated the nature of the intraburst kinetics by using recombinant Kir6.2/{SUR}1 {KATP} channels heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Single-channel currents were studied in inside-out membrane patches. Mutations within the pore loop of Kir6.2 (V127T, G135F, and M137C) dramatically affected the mean open time (τo) and the short closed time (τC1) within a burst, and the number of openings per burst, but did not alter the burst duration, the interburst closed time, or the channel open probability. Thus, the V127T and M137C mutations produced longer τo, shorter τC1, and fewer openings per burst, whereas the G135F mutation had the opposite effect. All three mutations also reduced the single-channel conductance: from 70 {pS} for the wild-type channel to 62 {pS} (G135F), 50 {pS} (M137C), and 38 {pS} (V127T). These results are consistent with the idea that the {KATP} channel possesses a gate that governs the intraburst kinetics, which lies close to the selectivity filter. This gate appears to be able to operate independently of that which regulates the long interburst closings.},

	abstract = {{ATP}-sensitive potassium ({KATP}) channels are found in a wide variety of cell types where they couple cell metabolism to electrical activity. In glucose-sensing tissues, these channels respond to fluctuating changes in blood glucose concentration, but in other tissues they are activated only under ischemic conditions or in response to hormonal stimulation. Although {KATP} channels in different tissues have different regulatory subunits, in almost all cases (except vascular smooth muscle) the pore-forming subunit is the inwardly rectifying K+ channel Kir6.2. This article reviews recent studies of Kir6.2, focussing on the relation between channel structure and function, and on naturally occurring mutations in Kir6.2 that lead to human disease. New insights into the location of the {ATP}-binding site, the permeation pathway for K+, and the gating of the pore provided by homology modelling are discussed in relation to functional studies. Gain-of-function mutations in Kir6.2 cause permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus ({PNDM}) by reducing the {ATP} sensitivity of the {KATP} channel and increasing the {KATP} current, which is predicted to inhibit beta-cell electrical activity and insulin secretion. Mutations at specific residues, that cause a greater decrease in {ATP} sensitivity, are associated with additional neurological symptoms. The molecular mechanism underlying the differences in {ATP} sensitivity produced by these two classes of mutations is discussed. We speculate on how some mutations lead to neurological disease and why no obvious cardiac symptoms are observed. We also consider the implications of these studies for type-2 diabetes.},

	abstract = {The mechanism by which {ATP}-sensitive K+ ({KATP}) channels open in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of {ATP} remains unknown. Herein, using a four-state kinetic model, we found that the nucleotide diphosphate {UDP} directed cardiac {KATP} channels to operate within intraburst transitions. These transitions are not targeted by {ATP}, nor the structurally unrelated sulfonylurea glyburide, which inhibit channel opening by acting on interburst transitions. Therefore, the channel remained insensitive to {ATP} and glyburide in the presence of {UDP}. “Rundown” of channel activity decreased the efficacy with which {UDP} could direct and maintain the channel to operate within intraburst transitions. Under this condition, the channel was sensitive to inhibition by {ATP} and glyburide despite the presence of {UDP}. This behavior of the {KATP} channel could be accounted for by an allosteric model of ligand-channel interaction. Thus, the response of cardiac {KATP} channels towards inhibitory ligands is determined by the relative lifetime the channel spends in a ligand-sensitive versus -insensitive state. Interconversion between these two conformational states represents a novel basis for {KATP} channel opening in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of {ATP} in a cardiac cell.},

	abstract = {Inward currents through single K+ channels in isolated ventricular heart cells of the guinea-pig were recorded using the patch-clamp technique (Hamill, Marty, Neher, Sakmann \& Sigworth, 1981). The voltage-dependent gating properties of the channels were examined in the potential range between 0 and -120 {mV} with 145 {mM}-{KCl} on the extracellular side of the membrane patch, i.e. with approximately symmetrical transmembrane K+ concentrations. When voltage pulses from 0 {mV} to negative test potentials were applied to patches containing several channels, more channels were open at the beginning of the pulses than in the steady state. Averages of many current responses showed inactivation of the mean current in response to the hyperpolarizing voltage pulses. The inactivation was stronger and faster at larger hyperpolarization. The lifetimes of the open and closed states of the channel and the probability of the open state p were estimated from records of the elementary currents at various constant potentials. As indicated by the inactivation of the averaged currents, the value of p was smaller at more negative potentials, approximately 0.15 at -50 {mV} and 0.02 at -110 {mV}. This caused a negative slope in the current-voltage relation of the time-averaged current at potentials more negative than -50 {mV}. The channel openings were grouped in complex bursts. At least three exponentials were needed to fit the frequency histogram of the lifetimes of all closed states (time constants at -50 {mV}: 1.1 ms, 16 ms and 3.2 s). The lifetimes of the individual openings were exponentially distributed (time constant: 70 ms). The kinetics of the channel were interpreted by two different models involving three states of a channel (closed-closed-open or closed-open-closed). The rate constants and their voltage dependence were estimated for both models. Both models describe the data equally well; the reason for this ambiguity is discussed. The channels are blocked by Cs+ or Ba2+. Cs+ (0.1 {mM}) caused frequent and short interruptions of the individual channel openings. Ba2+ (0.5 {mM}) also shortened the openings and in addition decreased the number of openings per burst. The results suggest that the inward-rectifying current {IK}1 in heart ventricular cells is partially inactivated by hyperpolarization. The inactivation could account for part of the time-dependent decrease in the whole-cell current previously ascribed to depletion of K+.},

In this review, we discuss the structure of various kinds of potassium channels, including the potassium channel with the pore-forming domain only ({KcsA}), voltage-gated, inwardly rectifying, tandem pore domain, and ligand-gated ones. The general properties shared by all potassium channels are introduced first, followed by specific features in each class.

	abstract = {1 We have examined the mechanism by which nucleotides modulate the tolbutamide block of the beta-cell {ATP}-sensitive K+ channel ({KATP} channel), using wild-type and mutant {KATP} channels heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. This channel is composed of sulphonylurea receptor ({SUR}1) and pore-forming (Kir6.2) subunits. 2 The dose–response relation for tolbutamide block of wild-type {KATP} currents in the absence of nucleotide showed both a high-affinity (Ki=2.0 μm) and a low-affinity (Ki=1.8 mm) site. 3 The dose–response relation for tolbutamide block of Kir6.2{ΔC}36 (a truncated form of Kir6.2 which is expressed independently of {SUR}1) was best fitted with a single, low-affinity site (Ki=1.7 mm). This indicates that the high-affinity site resides on {SUR}1, whereas the low-affinity site is located on Kir6.2. 4 {ADP} (100 μM) had a dual effect on wild-type {KATP} currents: the nucleotide enhanced the current in the presence of Mg2+, but was inhibitory in the absence of Mg2+. Kir6.2{ΔC}36 currents were blocked by 100 μM {ADP} in the presence of Mg2+. 5 For wild-type {KATP} currents, the blocking effect of 0.5 mm tolbutamide appeared greater in the presence of 100 μm {MgADP} (84 ± 2\%) than in its absence (59 ± 4\%). When {SUR}1 was mutated to abolish {MgADP} activation of {KATP} currents (K719A or K1384M), there was no difference in the extent of tolbutamide inhibition in the presence or absence of {MgADP}. 6 The ki for tolbutamide interaction with either the high- or low-affinity site was unaffected by 100 μM {MgADP}, for both wild-type and K719A-K1384M currents. 7 {MgGDP} (100{μM}) enhanced wild-type {KATP} currents and was without effect on K719A– K1384M currents. It did not affect the ki for tolbutamide block at either the high- or low-affinity site. 8 Our results indicate that interaction of tolbutamide with the high-affinity site (on {SUR}1) abolishes the stimulatory action of {MgADP}. This unmasks the inhibitory effect of {ADP} and leads to an apparent increase in channel inhibition. Under physiological conditions, abolition of {MgADP} activation is likely to constitute the principal mechanism by which tolbutamide inhibits the {KATP} channel.},

	abstract = {{ATP}-sensitive potassium ({KATP}) channels in the pancreatic beta cell membrane mediate insulin release in response to elevation of plasma glucose levels. They are open at rest but close in response to glucose metabolism, producing a depolarization that stimulates Ca2+ influx and exocytosis. Metabolic regulation of {KATP} channel activity currently is believed to be mediated by changes in the intracellular concentrations of {ATP} and {MgADP}, which inhibit and activate the channel, respectively. The beta cell {KATP} channel is a complex of four Kir6.2 pore-forming subunits and four {SUR}1 regulatory subunits: Kir6.2 mediates channel inhibition by {ATP}, whereas the potentiatory action of {MgADP} involves the nucleotide-binding domains ({NBDs}) of {SUR}1. We show here that {MgATP} (like {MgADP}) is able to stimulate {KATP} channel activity, but that this effect normally is masked by the potent inhibitory effect of the nucleotide. Mg2+ caused an apparent reduction in the inhibitory action of {ATP} on wild-type {KATP} channels, and {MgATP} actually activated {KATP} channels containing a mutation in the Kir6.2 subunit that impairs nucleotide inhibition (R50G). Both of these effects were abolished when mutations were made in the {NBDs} of {SUR}1 that are predicted to abolish {MgATP} binding and/or hydrolysis (D853N, D1505N, K719A, or K1384M). These results suggest that, like {MgADP}, {MgATP} stimulates {KATP} channel activity by interaction with the {NBDs} of {SUR}1. Further support for this idea is that the {ATP} sensitivity of a truncated form of Kir6.2, which shows functional expression in the absence of {SUR}1, is unaffected by Mg2+.},

This activation was largely suppressed by mutation of the Walker A lysines in the nucleotide-binding domains of {SUR}1: the remaining small (∼10\%), slowly developing component of {MgATP} activation was fully inhibited by the lipid kinase inhibitor {LY}294002. The {EC}50 for activation of Kir6.2-G334D/{SUR}1 currents by {MgADP} was lower than that for {MgATP}, and the time course of activation was faster. The poorly hydrolyzable analogue {MgATPγS} also activated Kir6.2-G334D/{SUR}1. {AMPPCP} both failed to activate Kir6.2-G334D/{SUR}1 and to prevent its activation by {MgATP}. Maximal stimulatory concentrations of {MgATP} (10 {mM}) and {MgADP} (1 {mM}) exerted identical effects on the single-channel kinetics: they dramatically elevated the open probability ({PO} \&gt; 0.8), increased the mean open time and the mean burst duration, reduced the frequency and number of interburst closed states, and eliminated the short burst states. By comparing our results with those obtained for wild-type {KATP} channels, we conclude that the {MgADP} sensitivity of the wild-type {KATP} channel can be described quantitatively by a combination of inhibition at Kir6.2 (measured for wild-type channels in the absence of Mg2+) and activation via {SUR}1 (determined for Kir6.2-G334D/{SUR}1 channels).

Effects of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate ({PIP}2) and multiple Kir6.2 mutations on {ATP} inhibition and open probability in the absence of {ATP} are explainable in kinetic models where {ATP} stabilizes a closed state and interaction with an open state is not required. Evidence that {ATP} can in fact interact with the open state of the channel is presented here. The mutant Kir6.2[L164C] is very sensitive to Cd2+ block, but very insensitive to {ATP}, with no significant inhibition in 1mM {ATP}. However, 1mM {ATP} fully protects the channel from Cd2+ block. Allosteric kinetic models in which the channel can be in either open or closed states with or without {ATP} bound are considered. Such models predict a pedestal in the {ATP} inhibition, i.e., a maximal amount of inhibition at saturating {ATP} concentrations. This pedestal is predicted to occur at {\textgreater}50mM {ATP} in the L164C mutant, but at {\textgreater}1mM in the double mutant L164C/R176A. As predicted, {ATP} inhibits Kir6.2[L164C/R176A] to a maximum of ∼40\%, with a clear plateau beyond 2mM. These results indicate that {ATP} acts as an allosteric ligand, interacting with both open and closed states of the channel.},

	abstract = {With the increasing incidence of diabetic retinopathy and its improved detection, there is increased demand for diabetic retinopathy treatment services. Prognostic prediction models have been used to optimise services but these were intended for early detection of sight-threatening retinopathy and are mostly used in diabetic retinopathy screening services. We wanted to look into the predictive ability and applicability of the existing models for the higher-risk patients referred into hospitals. We searched {MEDLINE}, {EMBASE}, {COCHRANE} {CENTRAL}, conference abstracts and reference lists of included publications for studies of any design using search terms related to diabetes, diabetic retinopathy and prognostic models. Search results were screened for relevance to the review question. Included studies had data extracted on model characteristics, predictive ability and validation. They were assessed for quality using criteria specified by {PROBAST} and {CHARMS} checklists, independently by two reviewers. Twenty-two articles reporting on 14 prognostic models (including four updates) met the selection criteria. Eleven models had internal validation, eight had external validation and one had neither. Discriminative ability with c-statistics ranged from 0.57 to 0.91. Studies ranged from low to high risk of bias, mostly due to the need for external validation or missing data. Participants, outcomes, predictors handling and modelling methods varied. Most models focussed on lower-risk patients, the majority had high risk of bias and doubtful applicability, but three models had some applicability for higher-risk patients. However, these models will also need updating and external validation in multiple hospital settings before being implemented into clinical practice.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:
The English {NHS} Diabetic Eye Screening Programme was established in 2003. Eligible people are invited annually for digital retinal photography screening. Those found to have potentially sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy ({STDR}) are referred to surveillance clinics or to Hospital Eye Services.
{OBJECTIVES}:
To determine whether personalised screening intervals are cost-effective.
{DESIGN}:
Risk factors were identified in Gloucestershire, {UK} using survival modelling. A probabilistic decision hidden (unobserved) Markov model with a misgrading matrix was developed. This informed estimation of lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years ({QALYs}) in patients without {STDR}. Two personalised risk stratification models were employed: two screening episodes ({SEs}) (low, medium or high risk) or one {SE} with clinical information (low, medium-low, medium-high or high risk). The risk factor models were validated in other populations.
{SETTING}:
Gloucestershire, Nottinghamshire, South London and East Anglia (all {UK}).
{PARTICIPANTS}:
People with diabetes in Gloucestershire with risk stratification model validation using data from Nottinghamshire, South London and East Anglia.
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}:
Personalised risk-based algorithm for screening interval; cost-effectiveness of different screening intervals.
{RESULTS}:
Data were obtained in Gloucestershire from 12,790 people with diabetes with known risk factors to derive the risk estimation models, from 15,877 people to inform the uptake of screening and from 17,043 people to inform the health-care resource-usage costs. Two stratification models were developed: one using only results from previous screening events and one using previous screening and some commonly available {GP} data. Both models were capable of differentiating groups at low and high risk of development of {STDR}. The rate of progression to {STDR} was 5 per 1000 person-years ({PYs}) in the lowest decile of risk and 75 per 1000 {PYs} in the highest decile. In the absence of personalised risk stratification, the most cost-effective screening interval was to screen all patients every 3 years, with a 46\% probability of this being cost-effective at a £30,000 per {QALY} threshold. Using either risk stratification models, screening patients at low risk every 5 years was the most cost-effective option, with a probability of 99-100\% at a £30,000 per {QALY} threshold. For the medium-risk groups screening every 3 years had a probability of 43-48\% while screening high-risk groups every 2 years was cost-effective with a probability of 55-59\%.
{CONCLUSIONS}:
The study found that annual screening of all patients for {STDR} was not cost-effective. Screening this entire cohort every 3 years was most likely to be cost-effective. When personalised intervals are applied, screening those in our low-risk groups every 5 years was found to be cost-effective. Screening high-risk groups every 2 years further improved the cost-effectiveness of the programme. There was considerable uncertainty in the estimated incremental costs and in the incremental {QALYs}, particularly with regard to implications of an increasing proportion of maculopathy cases receiving intravitreal injection rather than laser treatment. Future work should focus on improving the understanding of risk, validating in further populations and investigating quality issues in imaging and assessment including the potential for automated image grading.},

	abstract = {1 {ATP}-sensitive potassium ({KATP}) channels are composed of pore-forming (Kir6.x) and regulatory sulphonylurea receptor ({SURx}) subunits. We have isolated a novel {SUR} variant ({SUR}1bΔ33) from a hypothalamic {cDNA} library. This variant lacked exon 33 and introduced a frameshift that produced a truncated protein lacking the second nucleotide binding domain ({NBD}2). It was expressed at low levels in hypothalamus, midbrain, heart and the insulin-secreting beta-cell line {MIN}6. 2 We examined the properties of {KATP} channels composed of Kir6.2 and {SUR}1bΔ33 by recording macroscopic currents in membrane patches excised from Xenopus oocytes expressing these subunits. We also investigated the effect of truncating {SUR}1 at either the start ({SUR}1bT1) or end ({SUR}1bT2) of exon 33 on {KATP} channel properties. 3 Kir6.2/{SUR}1bΔ33 showed an enhanced open probability (Po= 0.6 at -60 {mV}) and a reduced {ATP} sensitivity (Ki, 86 μm), when compared with wild-type channels (Po= 0.3; Ki, 22 μm). However, Kir6.2/{SUR}1bT1 and Kir6.2/{SUR}1bT2 resembled the wild-type channel in their Po and {ATP} sensitivity. 4 Neither {MgADP}, nor the K+ channel opener diazoxide, enhanced Kir6.2/{SUR}1bΔ33, Kir6.2/{SUR}1bT1 or Kir6.2/{SUR}1bT2 currents, consistent with the idea that these agents require an intact {NBD}2 for their action. Sulphonylureas blocked {KATP} channels containing any of the three {SUR} variants, but in excised patches the extent of block was less than that for the wild-type channel. In intact cells, the extent of sulphonylurea block of Kir6.2/{SUR}1bΔ33 was greater than that in excised patches and was comparable to that found for wild-type channels. 5 Our results demonstrate that {NBD}2 is not essential for functional expression or sulphonylurea block, but is required for {KATP} channel activation by K+ channel openers and nucleotides. Some of the unusual properties of Kir6.2/{SUR}1bΔ33 resemble those reported for the {KATP} channel of ventromedial hypothalamic ({VMH}) neurones, but the fact that this {mRNA} is expressed at low levels in many other tissues makes it less likely that {SUR}1bΔ33 serves as the {SUR} subunit for the {VMH} {KATP} channel.},

Nonconservative substitutions of two threonine residues and the tyrosine residue leave selectivity intact. In contrast, mutations at some positions render the channel nonselective among monovalent cations. These findings are consistent with a proposal that the signature sequence contributes to a selectivity filter.

	abstract = {Inwardly rectifying K+ (Kir) channels allow K+ to move more easily into rather than out of the cell. They have diverse physiological functions depending on their type and their location. There are seven Kir channel subfamilies that can be classified into four functional groups: classical Kir channels (Kir2.x) are constitutively active, G protein-gated Kir channels (Kir3.x) are regulated by G protein-coupled receptors, {ATP}-sensitive K+ channels (Kir6.x) are tightly linked to cellular metabolism, and K+ transport channels (Kir1.x, Kir4.x, Kir5.x, and Kir7.x). Inward rectification results from pore block by intracellular substances such as Mg2+ and polyamines. Kir channel activity can be modulated by ions, phospholipids, and binding proteins. The basic building block of a Kir channel is made up of two transmembrane helices with cytoplasmic {NH}2 and {COOH} termini and an extracellular loop which folds back to form the pore-lining ion selectivity filter. In vivo, functional Kir channels are composed of four such subunits which are either homo- or heterotetramers. Gene targeting and genetic analysis have linked Kir channel dysfunction to diverse pathologies. The crystal structure of different Kir channels is opening the way to understanding the structure-function relationships of this simple but diverse ion channel family.},

	abstract = {K+ channels achieve exquisite ion selectivity without jeopardizing efficient permeation by employing multiple, interacting K+-binding sites. Introduction of a cadmium (Cd2+)-binding site in the external vestibule of Kv2.1 (drk1), allowed us to functionally characterize a binding site for external monovalent cations. Permeant ions displayed higher affinity for this site than non-permeant monovalent cations, although the selectivity profile was different from that of the channel. Point mutations identified the highly conserved aspartate residue immediately following the selectivity filter as a critical determinant of the antagonism between external K+ and Cd2+ ions. A conservative mutation at this position (D378E) significantly affected the open-state stability. Moreover, the mean open time was found to be modulated by external K+ concentration, suggesting a coupling between channel closing and the permeation process. Reducing the Rb+ conductance by mutating the selectivity filter to the sequence found in Kv4.1, also significantly reduced the effectiveness of Rb+ ions to antagonize Cd2+ inhibition, thereby implicating the selectivity filter as the site at which K+ ions exert their antagonistic effect on Cd2+ block. The equivalent of D378 in {KcsA}, D80, takes part in an inter-subunit hydrogen-bond network that allows D80 to functionally interact with the selectivity filter. The results suggest that external K+ ions antagonize Cd2+ inhibition (in I379C) and modulate the mean open time (in the wild-type Kv2.1) by altering the occupancy profile of the K+-binding sites in the selectivity filter.},

Functional analysis revealed the F60Y mutation increases the intrinsic channel open probability (Po (0) ), thereby indirectly producing a marked decrease in channel inhibition by {ATP} and an increase in whole-cell K {ATP} currents. When expressed alone, the V64L mutation caused a small reduction in apparent {ATP} inhibition, by enhancing the ability of {MgATP} to stimulate channel activity. The V64L mutation also ameliorated the deleterious effects on the F60Y mutation when it was expressed on the same (but not a different) subunit.

Heterozygous mutations in the human Kir6.2 gene ({KCNJ}11), the pore-forming subunit of the {ATP}-sensitive ({KATP}) channel, cause permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus ({PNDM}). For some mutations, {PNDM} is accompanied by marked developmental delay, muscle weakness, and epilepsy (severe disease). To determine the molecular basis of these different phenotypes, we expressed wild-type or mutant (R201C, Q52R, or V59G) Kir6.2/sulfonylurea receptor 1 channels in Xenopus oocytes. All mutations increased resting whole-cell {KATP} currents by reducing channel inhibition by {ATP}, but, in the simulated heterozygous state, mutations causing {PNDM} alone (R201C) produced smaller {KATP} currents and less change in {ATP} sensitivity than mutations associated with severe disease (Q52R and V59G). This finding suggests that increased {KATP} currents hyperpolarize pancreatic beta cells and impair insulin secretion, whereas larger {KATP} currents are required to influence extrapancreatic cell function. We found that mutations causing {PNDM} alone impair {ATP} sensitivity directly (at the binding site), whereas those associated with severe disease act indirectly by biasing the channel conformation toward the open state. The effect of the mutation on {ATP} sensitivity in the heterozygous state reflects the different contributions of a single subunit in the Kir6.2 tetramer to {ATP} inhibition and to the energy of the open state. Our results also show that mutations in the slide helix of Kir6.2 (V59G) influence the channel kinetics, providing evidence that this domain is involved in Kir channel gating, and suggest that the efficacy of sulfonylurea therapy in {PNDM} may vary with genotype.},

	abstract = {Cantu syndrome ({CS}) is a condition characterized by a range of anatomical defects, including cardiomegaly, hyperflexibility of the joints, hypertrichosis, and craniofacial dysmorphology. {CS} is associated with multiple missense mutations in the genes encoding the regulatory sulfonylurea receptor 2 ({SUR}2) subunits of the {ATP}-sensitive K+ ({KATP}) channel as well as two mutations (V65M and C176S) in the Kir6.1 ({KCNJ}8) subunit. Previous analysis of leucine and alanine substitutions at the Val-65-equivalent site (Val-64) in Kir6.2 indicated no major effects on channel function. In this study, we characterized the effects of both valine-to-methionine and valine-to-leucine substitutions at this position in both Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 using ion flux and patch clamp techniques. We report that methionine substitution, but not leucine substitution, results in increased open state stability and hence significantly reduced {ATP} sensitivity and a marked increase of channel activity in the intact cell irrespective of the identity of the coassembled {SUR} subunit. Sulfonylurea inhibitors, such as glibenclamide, are potential therapies for {CS}. However, as a consequence of the increased open state stability, both Kir6.1(V65M) and Kir6.2(V64M) mutations essentially abolish high-affinity sensitivity to the {KATP} blocker glibenclamide in both intact cells and excised patches. This raises the possibility that, at least for some {CS} mutations, sulfonylurea therapy may not prove to be successful and highlights the need for detailed pharmacogenomic analyses of {CS} mutations.},

In this study we report that anionic phospholipids activated {KATP} in pancreatic beta-cells, cardiac myocytes, skeletal muscle cells, and a cloned {KATP} composed of two subunits ({SUR}/Kir6.2) stably expressed in a mammalian cell line. The effectiveness was proportional to the number of negative charges on the head group of the anionic phospholipid. Screening negative charges with polyvalent cations antagonized the effect. Enzymatic treatment with phospholipases that reduced charge on the lipids also reduced or eliminated the effect. These results suggest that intact phospholipids with negative charges are the critical requirement for activation of {KATP}, in distinction from the usual cell signaling pathway through phospholipids that requires cleavage. Mutations of two positively charged amino acid residues at the C terminus of Kir6.2 accelerated loss of channel activity and reduced the activating effects of phospholipids, suggesting involvement of this region in the activation. Metabolism of anionic phospholipids in plasmalemmal membrane may be a novel and general mechanism for regulation of {KATP} and perhaps other ion channels in the family of inward rectifiers.},

The effect of phosphoinositides on adenosine triphosphate ({ATP}) inhibition of {ATP}-sensitive potassium channel ({KATP}) currents was investigated using the inside-out patch clamp technique in cardiac myocytes and in {COS}-1 cells in which the cardiac isoform of the sulfonylurea receptor, {SUR}2, was coexpressed with the inwardly rectifying channel Kir6.2. Phosphoinositides (1 mg/ml) increased the open probability of {KATP} in low [{ATP}] (1 μM) within 30 s. Phosphoinositides desensitized {ATP} inhibition with a longer onset period (\&gt;3 min), activating channels inhibited by {ATP} (1 {mM}). Phosphoinositides treatment for 10 min shifted the half-inhibitory [{ATP}] (Ki) from 35 μM to 16 {mM}. At the single-channel level, increased [{ATP}] caused a shorter mean open time and a longer mean closed time. Phosphoinositides prolonged the mean open time, shortened the mean closed time, and weakened the [{ATP}] dependence of these parameters resulting in a higher open probability at any given [{ATP}]. The apparent rate constants for {ATP} binding were estimated to be 0.8 and 0.02 {mM}−1 ms−1 before and after 5-min treatment with phosphoinositides, which corresponds to a Ki of 35 μM and 5.8 {mM}, respectively. Phosphoinositides failed to desensitize adenosine inhibition of {KATP}. In the presence of {SUR}2, phosphoinositides attenuated {MgATP} antagonism of {ATP} inhibition. Kir6.2{ΔC}35, a truncated Kir6.2 that functions without {SUR}2, also exhibited phosphoinositide desensitization of {ATP} inhibition. These data suggest that (a) phosphoinositides strongly compete with {ATP} at a binding site residing on Kir6.2; (b) electrostatic interaction is a characteristic property of this competition; and (c) in conjunction with {SUR}2, phosphoinositides render additional, complex effects on {ATP} inhibition. We propose a model of the {ATP} binding site involving positively charged residues on the {COOH}-terminus of Kir6.2, with which phosphoinositides interact to desensitize {ATP} inhibition.},

All Kir6.2 mutations identified to date are missense mutations. We describe here a novel in-frame deletion (residues 28-32) in Kir6.2 in a heterozygous patient with {PNDM} without neurological problems that are detectable by standard evaluation.Objective: The aim of the study was to identify the mutation responsible for neonatal diabetes in this patient and characterize its functional effects.Design: Wild-type and mutant Kir6.2/{SUR}1 channels were examined by heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes.Results: The Kir6.2-28Δ32 mutation produced a significant decrease in {ATP} inhibition and an increase in whole-cell {KATP} currents, explaining the diabetes of the patient. Tolbutamide block was only slightly reduced in the simulated heterozygous state, suggesting that the patient should respond to sulfonylurea therapy. The mutation decreased {ATP} inhibition indirectly, by increasing the intrinsic (unliganded) channel open probability. Neither effect was observed when Kir6.2 was expressed in the absence of {SUR}1, suggesting that the mutation impairs coupling between {SUR}1 and Kir6.2. Coimmunoprecipitation studies further revealed that the mutation disrupted a physical interaction between Kir6.2 and residues 1-288 (but not residues 1-196) of {SUR}1.Conclusions: We report a novel {KCNJ}11 mutation causing {PNDM}. Our results show that residues 28-32 in the N terminus of Kir6.2 interact both physically and functionally with {SUR}1 and suggest that residues 196-288 of {SUR}1 are important in this interaction.},

We investigated the functional effects this mutation and another at the same residue (R50P) that led to {PNDM} in association with developmental delay. Wild-type or mutant Kir6.2/{SUR}1 channels were examined by heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes. Both mutations increased resting whole-cell currents through homomeric and heterozygous {KATP} channels by reducing channel inhibition by {ATP}, an effect that was larger in the presence of Mg2+. However the magnitude of the reduction in {ATP} sensitivity (and the increase in the whole-cell current) was substantially larger for the R50P mutation. This is consistent with the more severe phenotype. Single–R50P channel kinetics (in the absence of {ATP}) did not differ from wild type, indicating that the mutation primarily affects {ATP} binding and/or transduction. This supports the idea that R50 lies in the {ATP}-binding site of Kir6.2. The sulfonylurea tolbutamide blocked heterozygous R50Q (89\%) and R50P (84\%) channels only slightly less than wild-type channels (98\%), suggesting that sulfonylurea therapy may be of benefit for patients with either mutation.},

	abstract = {The prediction that overactivity of the pancreatic {ATP}-sensitive K+ channel ({KATP} channel) underlies reduced insulin secretion and causes a diabetic phenotype in humans has recently been borne out by genetic studies implicating “activating” mutations in the Kir6.2 subunit of {KATP} as causal in both permanent and transient neonatal diabetes. Here we characterize the channel properties of Kir6.2 mutations that underlie transient neonatal diabetes (I182V) or more severe forms of permanent neonatal diabetes (V59M, Q52R, and I296L). In all cases, the mutations result in a significant decrease in sensitivity to inhibitory {ATP}, which correlates with channel “overactivity” in intact cells. Mutations can be separated into those that directly affect {ATP} affinity (I182V) and those that stabilize the open conformation of the channel and indirectly reduce {ATP} sensitivity (V59M, Q52R, and I296L). With respect to the latter group, alterations in channel gating are also reflected in a functional “uncoupling” of sulfonylurea ({SU}) block: {SU} sensitivity of I182V is similar to that of wild-type mutants, but the {SU} sensitivity of all gating mutants is reduced, with the I296L mutant being resistant to block by tolbutamide (≤10 mmol/l). These results have important implications for the use of insulinotropic {SU} drugs as an alternative therapy to insulin injections.},

However, despite the importance of {KATP} channels in the heart, patients have no obvious cardiac problems. We examined the effects of adenine nucleotides on {KATP} channels containing wild-type or mutant (Q52R, R201H) Kir6.2 plus either {SUR}1 or {SUR}2A. In the absence of Mg2+, both mutations reduced {ATP} inhibition of {SUR}1- and {SUR}2A-containing channels to similar extents, but when Mg2+ was present {ATP} blocked mutant channels containing {SUR}1 much less than {SUR}2A channels. Mg-nucleotide activation of {SUR}1, but not {SUR}2A, channels was markedly increased by the R201H mutation. Both mutations also increased resting whole-cell {KATP} currents through heterozygous {SUR}1-containing channels to a greater extent than for heterozygous {SUR}2A-containing channels. The greater {ATP} inhibition of mutant Kir6.2/{SUR}2A than of Kir6.2/{SUR}1 can explain why gain-of-function Kir6.2 mutations manifest effects in brain and beta-cells but not in the heart.},

Mutations in {SUR}1 or Kir6.2 that decrease channel function are typically associated with congenital hyperinsulinism, whereas those that increase channel function are associated with neonatal diabetes. Here we report that two hyperinsulinism-associated {SUR}1 missense mutations, R74W and E128K, surprisingly reduce channel inhibition by intracellular {ATP}, a gating defect expected to yield the opposite disease phenotype neonatal diabetes. Under normal conditions, both mutant channels showed poor surface expression due to retention in the endoplasmic reticulum, accounting for the loss of channel function phenotype in the congenital hyperinsulinism patients. This trafficking defect, however, could be corrected by treating cells with the oral hypoglycemic drugs sulfonylureas, which we have shown previously to act as small molecule chemical chaperones for {KATP} channels. The R74W and E128K mutants thus rescued to the cell surface paradoxically exhibited {ATP} sensitivity 6- and 12-fold lower than wild-type channels, respectively. Further analyses revealed a nucleotide-independent decrease in mutant channel intrinsic open probability, suggesting the mutations may reduce {ATP} sensitivity by causing functional uncoupling between {SUR}1 and Kir6.2. In insulin-secreting cells, rescue of both mutant channels to the cell surface led to hyperpolarized membrane potentials and reduced insulin secretion upon glucose stimulation. Our results show that sulfonylureas, as chemical chaperones, can dictate manifestation of the two opposite insulin secretion defects by altering the expression levels of the disease mutants.},

It was soon extended to pharmacological receptors for neurotransmitters and other macromolecular entities involved in intracellular and intercellular communications. Five decades later, the two main hypotheses of the model are reexamined on the basis of a variety of regulatory proteins with known X-ray structures: (a) Regulatory proteins possess an oligomeric structure with symmetry properties, and (b) the allosteric interactions between topographically distinct sites are mediated by a conformational transition established between a few preestablished states with conservation of symmetry and ligand-directed conformational selection. Several well-documented examples are adequately represented by the {MWC} model, yet a few possible exceptions are noted. New questions are raised concerning the dynamics of the allosteric transitions and more complex supramolecular ensembles.},

Hence, a thorough mathematical analysis of the {MWC} model can illuminate the performance limits of a number of unrelated biological systems in one stroke. The goal of our review is twofold. First, we describe in detail the general physical principles that are used to derive the activity of {MWC} molecules as a function of their regulatory ligands. Second, we illustrate the power of ideas from information theory and dynamical systems for quantifying how well the output of {MWC} molecules tracks their sensory input, giving a sense of the “design” constraints faced by these receptors.},

For the past 50 years, Koshland's 'induced fit' hypothesis has been the textbook explanation for molecular recognition events. However, recent experimental evidence supports an alternative mechanism. 'Conformational selection' postulates that all protein conformations pre-exist, and the ligand selects the most favored conformation. Following binding the ensemble undergoes a population shift, redistributing the conformational states. Both conformational selection and induced fit appear to play roles. Following binding by a primary conformational selection event, optimization of side chain and backbone interactions is likely to proceed by an induced fit mechanism. Conformational selection has been observed for protein-ligand, protein-protein, protein-{DNA}, protein-{RNA} and {RNA}-ligand interactions. These data support a new molecular recognition paradigm for processes as diverse as signaling, catalysis, gene regulation and protein aggregation in disease, which has the potential to significantly impact our views and strategies in drug design, biomolecular engineering and molecular evolution.},

	abstract = {{KATP} channels act as key regulators of electrical excitability by coupling metabolic cues—mainly intracellular adenine nucleotide concentrations—to cellular potassium ion efflux. However, their study has been hindered by their rapid loss of activity in excised membrane patches (rundown), and by a second phenomenon, the decline of activation by Mg-nucleotides ({DAMN}). Degradation of {PI}(4,5)P2 and other phosphoinositides is the strongest candidate for the molecular cause of rundown. Broad evidence indicates that most other determinants of rundown (e.g. phosphorylation, intracellular calcium, channel mutations that affect rundown) also act by influencing {KATP} channel regulation by phosphoinositides. Unfortunately, experimental conditions that reproducibly prevent rundown have remained elusive, necessitating post hoc data compensation. Rundown is clearly distinct from {DAMN}. While the former is associated with pore-forming Kir6.2 subunits, {DAMN} is generally a slower process involving the regulatory sulfonylurea receptor ({SUR}) subunits. We speculate that it arises when {SUR} subunits enter non-physiological conformational states associated with the loss of {SUR} nucleotide-binding domain dimerization following prolonged exposure to nucleotide-free conditions. This review presents new information on both rundown and {DAMN}, summarizes our current understanding of these processes and considers their physiological roles.This article is part of the themed issue ‘Evolution brings Ca2+ and {ATP} together to control life and death’.},

We show that {PPIs} bind purified Kir6.2 in an isomer-specific manner, that biotinylated {ATP} analogs photoaffinity label purified Kir6.2, and that this labeling is weakened in the presence of {PPIs}. Patch-clamp measurements confirmed that these {ATP} analogs inhibited Kir6.2 channels, and that {PPIs} decreased the level of inhibition. These results indicate that interaction of {PPIs} with Kir6.2 impedes {ATP}-binding activity.

To examine the cellular trafficking of {KATP} channel subunits, green fluorescent protein ({GFP}) was tagged to the cytoplasmic N or C terminus of {SUR}1 and Kir6.2 subunits and to the C terminus of a dimeric fusion between {SUR}1 and Kir6.2 ({SUR}1-Kir6.2). All tagged constructs generated functional channels with essentially normal properties when coexpressed with the relevant other subunit. {GFP}-tagged Kir6.2 (Kir6.2-{GFP}) showed perinuclear and plasma membrane fluorescence patterns when expressed alone or with {SUR}1, and a very similar pattern was observed when channel-forming {SUR}1-Kir6.2-{GFP} was expressed on its own. In contrast, whereas {SUR}1 ({SUR}1-{GFP}) also showed a perinuclear and plasma membrane fluorescence pattern when expressed alone, an apparently cytoplasmic fluorescence was observed when coexpressed with Kir6.2 subunits. The results indicate that Kir6.2 subunits traffic to the plasma membrane in the presence or absence of {SUR}1, in contradiction to the hypothesis that homomeric Kir6.2 channels are not observed because {SUR}1 is required as a chaperone to guide Kir6.2 subunits through the secretory pathway.},

Although Kir6.2 has been extensively studied in numerous expression systems, a comprehensive description of an expression and purification protocol has not been reported. We expressed and characterized a recombinant Kir6.2, with an N-terminal decahistidine tag, enhanced green fluorescent protein ({eGFP}) and deletion of C-terminal 26 amino acids, in succession, denoted {eGFP}-Kir6.2Δ26. {eGFP}-Kir6.2Δ26 was expressed in {HEK}293 cells and a purification protocol developed. Electrophysiological characterization showed that {eGFP}-Kir6.2Δ26 retains native single channel conductance (64 ± 3.3 {pS}), mean open times (τ1 = 0.72 ms, τ2 = 15.3 ms) and {ATP} affinity ({IC}50 = 115 ± 25 μM) when expressed in {HEK}293 cells. Detergent screening using size exclusion chromatography ({SEC}) identified Fos-choline-14 ({FC}-14) as the most suitable surfactant for protein solubilization, as evidenced by maintenance of the native tetrameric structure in {SDS}-{PAGE} and western blot analysis. A two-step scheme using Co2+-metal affinity chromatography and {SEC} was implemented for purification. Purified protein activity was assessed by reconstituting {eGFP}-Kir6.2Δ26 in black lipid membranes ({BLMs}) composed of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine ({POPC}), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol) ({POPG}), l-α-phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate ({PIP}2) in a 89.5:10:0.5 mol ratio.

We implemented transition metal ion fluorescence resonance energy transfer ({tmFRET}) to measure distances between sites on the N-terminal ankyrin repeat domains ({ARDs}) of the pain-transducing ion channel {TRPV}1 and the intracellular surface of the plasma membrane. To preserve the native context, we used unroofed cells, and to specifically label sites in {TRPV}1, we incorporated a fluorescent, noncanonical amino acid, L-{ANAP}. A metal chelating lipid was used to decorate the plasma membrane with high-density/high-affinity metal-binding sites. The fluorescence resonance energy transfer ({FRET}) efficiencies between L-{ANAP} in {TRPV}1 and Co2+ bound to the plasma membrane were consistent with the arrangement of the {ARDs} in recent cryoelectron microscopy structures of {TRPV}1. No change in {tmFRET} was observed with the {TRPV}1 agonist capsaicin. These results demonstrate the power of {tmFRET} for measuring structure and rearrangements of membrane proteins relative to the cell membrane.},

Our study clearly shows that the change in fluorescence intensity of {TNP}-{ATP} with different solvent properties has disparate origins, which were obscured in previous steady-state measurements. The four main findings are as follows. First, the fluorescence lifetime of {TNP}-{ATP} was found to increase with increasing viscosity, resulting in an increase in quantum yield, and therefore, fluorescence intensity. Second, fluorescence intensity increased with increasing {pH} ranging from 2.4 to 8.1. However, the fluorescence lifetime was essentially independent of the change in {pH}. The change in fluorescence intensity was not due to variations in quantum yield, but to the change in absorbance with {pH}. Third, we examined the interaction of {TNP}-{ATP} with the Klenow fragment of {DNA} polymerase I and found that free {TNP}-{ATP} and bound {TNP}-{ATP} in two binding sites were distinguished by using time-resolved spectroscopy, although the binding site with lower affinity could not be resolved in previous steady-state measurements. As the enzyme concentration was increased, the fluorescence lifetime of the enzyme−{TNP}-{ATP} complex remained unchanged, but the fractional fluorescence intensity of the bound {TNP}-{ATP} increased, thus leading to an increase in total fluorescence photocounts. Last, the fluorescence of {TNP}-{ATP} in the presence of the enzyme was further enhanced by the addition of Mg2+. This enhancement was due to the increase in the fractional fluorescence intensity of the bound {TNP}-{ATP} rather than to the change in fluorescence lifetime. This finding indicates that Mg2+ raises the affinity of the enzyme for {TNP}-{ATP}.},

	abstract = {{ATP}-binding cassette ({ABC}) transporters constitute a ubiquitous superfamily of integral membrane proteins that are responsible for the {ATP}-powered translocation of many substrates across membranes.{ABC} transporters have a characteristic architecture that consists minimally of four domains: two {ABC} domains (or nucleotide-binding domains) with highly conserved sequence motifs and two transmembrane domains ({TMDs}). Additional domains can be fused to these core elements to confer regulatory functions, and a periplasmic binding protein is required for ligand delivery to prokaryotic importer members of this family.Similarities in the structure of the {ABC} domains structure support a common mechanism by which {ABC} transporters, both importers and exporters, orchestrate a series of nucleotide- and substrate-dependent conformational changes that result in substrate translocation across the membrane through an 'alternating-access'-type model. As {ABC} domains are also integrated into non-transport systems, including proteins that are involved in {DNA} repair and chromosome maintenance, it is likely that a common set of {ATP}-dependent conformational changes are relevant to all of these processes.The conformation of {ABC} transporters that is catalytically competent for nucleotide hydrolysis involves the binding of an {ATP} molecule between conserved sequence motifs at the interface between the two {ABC} domains. As a transporter cycles through the different stages of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, the interface between the two {ABC} domains switches from the closed state, which is characteristic of {ATP} binding, to a more open conformation, which is associated with non-{ATP} states.{TMDs} are structurally heterogeneous, and three distinct sets of folds have been recognized. Although the detailed folds vary, they all interact with the helical domains of the {ABCs} through 'coupling helices', which are located in the loops between membrane-spanning helices. These interactions connect the conformations of the {TMDs} to the nucleotide state of the {ABC} domains.The activity of {ABC} transporters can be regulated at the level of protein function through the actions of domains that are fused to the {ABCs} and/or {TMDs}. Recent structural studies have established that trans-inhibition, in which the uptake of an extracellular substrate is inhibited by increasing intracellular concentrations of that species, can involve ligand binding to the carboxy-terminal domains of the {ABCs} that sterically separate these domains and prevent their association, which is required for {ATP} hydrolysis.Although idealized kinetic models can be described that qualitatively highlight aspects of the transport mechanism, an important goal is to develop quantitative models that detail the kinetic and molecular mechanisms by which {ABC} transporters couple the binding and hydrolysis of {ATP} to substrate translocation.},

	abstract = {The {ATP}-sensitive potassium ({KATP}) channel couples glucose metabolism to insulin secretion in pancreatic beta-cells. It comprises regulatory sulfonylurea receptor 1 and pore-forming Kir6.2 subunits. Binding and/or hydrolysis of Mg-nucleotides at the nucleotide-binding domains of sulfonylurea receptor 1 stimulates channel opening and leads to membrane hyperpolarization and inhibition of insulin secretion. We report here the first purification and functional characterization of sulfonylurea receptor 1. We also compared the {ATPase} activity of sulfonylurea receptor 1 with that of the isolated nucleotide-binding domains (fused to maltose-binding protein to improve solubility). Electron microscopy showed that nucleotide-binding domains purified as ring-like complexes corresponding to ∼ 8 momomers. The {ATPase} activities expressed as maximal turnover rate [in nmol Pi·s−1·(nmol protein)−1] were 0.03, 0.03, 0.13 and 0.08 for sulfonylurea receptor 1, nucleotide-binding domain 1, nucleotide-binding domain 2 and a mixture of nucleotide-binding domain 1 and nucleotide-binding domain 2, respectively. Corresponding Km values (in mm) were 0.1, 0.6, 0.65 and 0.56, respectively. Thus sulfonylurea receptor 1 has a lower Km than either of the isolated nucleotide-binding domains, and a lower maximal turnover rate than nucleotide-binding domain 2. Similar results were found with {GTP}, but the Km values were lower. Mutation of the Walker A lysine in nucleotide-binding domain 1 (K719A) or nucleotide-binding domain 2 (K1385M) inhibited the {ATPase} activity of sulfonylurea receptor 1 by 60\% and 80\%, respectively. Beryllium fluoride (Ki 16 µm), but not {MgADP}, inhibited the {ATPase} activity of sulfonylurea receptor 1. In contrast, both {MgADP} and beryllium fluoride inhibited the {ATPase} activity of the nucleotide-binding domains. These data demonstrate that the {ATPase} activity of sulfonylurea receptor 1 differs from that of the isolated nucleotide-binding domains, suggesting that the transmembrane domains may influence the activity of the protein.},

	abstract = {{CFTR}, the {ABC} protein defective in cystic fibrosis, functions as an anion channel. Once phosphorylated by protein kinase A, a {CFTR} channel is opened and closed by events at its two cytosolic nucleotide binding domains ({NBDs}). Formation of a head-to-tail {NBD}1/{NBD}2 heterodimer, by {ATP} binding in two interfacial composite sites between conserved Walker A and B motifs of one {NBD} and the {ABC}-specific signature sequence of the other, has been proposed to trigger channel opening. {ATP} hydrolysis at the only catalytically competent interfacial site is suggested to then destabilize the {NBD} dimer and prompt channel closure. But this gating mechanism, and how tightly {CFTR} channel opening and closing are coupled to its catalytic cycle, remains controversial. Here we determine the distributions of open burst durations of individual {CFTR} channels, and use maximum likelihood to evaluate fits to equilibrium and nonequilibrium mechanisms and estimate the rate constants that govern channel closure. We examine partially and fully phosphorylated wild-type {CFTR} channels, and two mutant {CFTR} channels, each bearing a deleterious mutation in one or other composite {ATP} binding site. We show that the wild-type {CFTR} channel gating cycle is essentially irreversible and tightly coupled to the {ATPase} cycle, and that this coupling is completely destroyed by the {NBD}2 Walker B mutation D1370N but only partially disrupted by the {NBD}1 Walker A mutation K464A.},

	abstract = {In pancreatic beta cells, insulin secretion is tightly controlled by the cells’ metabolic state via the {ATP}-sensitive potassium ({KATP}) channel. {ATP} is a key mediator in this signaling process, where its role as an inhibitor of {KATP} channels has been extensively studied. Since the channel contains an {ATPase} as an accessory subunit, the possibility that {ATP} hydrolysis mediates {KATP} channel opening has also been proposed. However, a rigorous test of coupling between {ATP} hydrolysis and channel gating has not previously been performed. In the present work, we examine whether {KATP} channel gating obeys detailed balance in order to determine whether {ATP} hydrolysis is strongly coupled to the gating of the {KATP} channel. Single-channel records were obtained from inside-out patches of transiently transfected {HEK}-293 cells. Channel activity in membrane patches with exactly one channel shows no violations of microscopic reversibility. Although {KATP} channel gating shows long closed times on the time scale where {ATP} hydrolysis takes place, the time symmetry of channel gating indicates that it is not tightly coupled to {ATP} hydrolysis. This lack of coupling suggests that channel gating operates close to equilibrium; although detailed balance is not expected to hold for {ATP} hydrolysis, it still does so in channel gating. On the basis of these results, the function of the {ATPase} active site in channel gating may be to sense nucleotides by differential binding of {ATP} and {ADP}, rather than to drive a thermodynamically unfavorable conformational change.},

We found that channel behavior is determined by the {ATPase}-driven engagement of {SUR} into discrete conformations. Capture of the {SUR} catalytic cycle in prehydrolytic states facilitated pore closure, while recruitment of posthydrolytic intermediates translated in pore opening. In the cell, channel openers stabilized posthydrolytic states promoting {KATP} channel activation. Nucleotide exchange between intrinsic {ATPase} and {ATP}/{ADP}-scavenging systems defined the lifetimes of specific {SUR} conformations gating {KATP} channels.

	abstract = {Phosphoinositides are critical regulators of ion channel and transporter activity. Defects in interactions of inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels with phosphoinositides lead to disease. {ATP}-sensitive K+ channels ({KATP}) are unique among Kir channels in that they serve as metabolic sensors, inhibited by {ATP} while stimulated by long-chain ({LC}) acyl-{CoA}. Here we show that {KATP} are the least specific Kir channels in their activation by phosphoinositides and we demonstrate that {LC} acyl-{CoA} activation of these channels depends on their low phosphoinositide specificity. We provide a systematic characterization of phosphoinositide specificity of the entire Kir channel family expressed in Xenopus oocytes and identify molecular determinants of such specificity. We show that mutations in the Kir2.1 channel decreasing phosphoinositide specificity allow activation by {LC} acyl-{CoA}. Our data demonstrate that differences in phosphoinositide specificity determine the modulation of Kir channel activity by distinct regulatory lipids.},

	abstract = {Phosphatidylinositol polyphosphates ({PIPs}) are potent modulators of Kir channels. Previous studies have implicated basic residues in the C terminus of Kir6.2 channels as interaction sites for the {PIPs}. Here we examined the role of the N terminus and identified an arginine (Arg-54) as a major determinant for {PIP}2 modulation of {ATP} sensitivity in {KATP} channels. Mutation of Arg-54 to the neutral glutamine (R54Q) and, in particular, to the negatively charged glutamate (R54E) impaired {PIP}2 modulation of {ATP} inhibition, while mutation to lysine (R54K) had no effect. These data suggest that electrostatic interactions between {PIP}2 and Arg-54 are an essential step for the modulation of {ATP} sensitivity. This N-terminal {PIP}2 site is highly conserved in Kir channels with the exception of the {pH}-gated channels Kir1.1, Kir4.1, and Kir5.1 that contain a neutral residue at the corresponding positions. Introduction of an arginine at this position in Kir1.1 channels rendered the N-terminal {PIP}2 site functional largely increasing the {PIP}2 affinity. Moreover, Kir1.1 channels lose the ability to respond to physiological changes of the intracellular {pH}. These results explain the need of a silent N-terminal {PIP}2 site in {pH}-gated channels and highlight the N terminus as an important region for {PIP}2 modulation of Kir channel gating.},

	abstract = {Fluorescence resonance energy transfer ({FRET}) is a technique for measuring the distance between two points which are separated by approximately 10–75 A°. The technique is valuable because measurements can be made under physiological (or other) conditions with near angstrom resolution and with the exquisite sensitivity of fluorescence measurements. For these reasons, {FRET} has found wide use in polymer science, biochemistry, and structural biology. The extent of energy transfer can be measured because the fluorescence of the donor (both intensity and lifetime) decreases, or is quenched, and the acceptor, if fluorescent, increases its fluorescence, or becomes “sensitized,” with energy transfer. These changes in fluorescence can be measured by comparing a complex labeled with both donor and acceptor to ones labeled only with donor and only with acceptor. The ability to measure intensities and lifetimes of both donor and acceptor emission with high accuracy and excellent signal-to-background, coupled with the unusually large R0s, makes luminescence resonance energy transfer a potentially powerful technique for measuring distances in biological systems.},

This chapter discusses the applications of {FRET} to nucleic acid molecules conjugated to dye molecules; but in general, the donor-acceptor pairs can be free in solution, one or both bound to a macromolecule, or be an inherent part of the structure. The chapter discusses {FRET} specifying the physical parameters that are available from a variety of fluorescence measurements. In the chapter, some basic considerations and experimental procedures are described that are necessary to make reliable {FRET} measurements.

We simultaneously measured channel currents and nucleotide binding to Kir6.2. Fits to combined data sets suggest that {KATP} closes with only one nucleotide molecule bound. A Kir6.2 mutation (C166S) that increases channel activity did not affect nucleotide binding, but greatly perturbed the ability of bound nucleotide to inhibit {KATP}. Mutations at position K205 in {SUR}1 affected both nucleotide affinity and the ability of bound nucleotide to inhibit {KATP}.

	abstract = {Ion channels play important roles in human physiology and their dysfunction is linked to a variety of diseases. This has sparked considerable interest in their molecular function and pharmacology and generated a need to manipulate them with great precision. The use of high-sensitivity electrophysiological methods allows for the implementation of chemical biology manipulations, as even minute protein amounts can be studied. For example, modification of solvent-accessible cysteines is a powerful tool to site-selectively modify proteins through the introduction of charged moieties or those with fluorescent properties. This has been harnessed to study ion conduction pathways and monitor conformational dynamics. In ligand-directed chemistry, a high-affinity ligand is used to modify an ion channel with a chemical probe via a reactive linker. While these approaches are typically limited to extracellular positions, genetic code expansion provides a means to introduce non-canonical amino acids in any position of the protein. This enables the insertion of subtle analogues of naturally occurring side chains or the protein backbone, as well as amino acids with fluorescent, cross-linking or photo-switchable properties. Finally, protein semi-synthesis enables the simultaneous insertion of multiple modifications, including those that would not be tolerated by the ribosomal translation machinery. Collectively, these chemical biology tools have overcome various shortcomings of conventional mutagenesis and vastly expanded the scope of possible modifications and the type of ion channels they can be applied to. Their application in both heterologous and native cell systems will no doubt play an increasingly important role in ion channel research.},

Addressing this challenge will allow the synthesis of modified recombinant proteins and augment emerging strategies that introduce new chemical functionalities into proteins to control and image their function with high spatial and temporal precision in cells. The efficiency of unnatural amino acid incorporation in response to the amber stop codon ({UAG}) in mammalian cells is commonly considered to be low. Here we demonstrate that {tRNA} levels can be limiting for unnatural amino acid incorporation efficiency, and we develop an optimized pyrrolysyl-{tRNA} synthetase/{tRNACUA} expression system, with optimized {tRNA} expression for mammalian cells. In addition, we engineer {eRF}1, that normally terminates translation on all three stop codons, to provide a substantial increase in unnatural amino acid incorporation in response to the {UAG} codon without increasing readthrough of other stop codons. By combining the optimized pyrrolysyl-{tRNA} synthetase/{tRNACUA} expression system and an engineered {eRF}1, we increase the yield of protein bearing unnatural amino acids at a single site 17- to 20-fold. Using the optimized system, we produce proteins containing unnatural amino acids with comparable yields to a protein produced from a gene that does not contain a {UAG} stop codon. Moreover, the optimized system increases the yield of protein, incorporating an unnatural amino acid at three sites, from unmeasurably low levels up to 43\% of a no amber stop control. Our approach may enable the efficient production of site-specifically modified therapeutic proteins, and the quantitative replacement of targeted cellular proteins with versions bearing unnatural amino acids that allow imaging or synthetic regulation of protein function.},

However, mechanisms underlying pharmacological correction of such defects, especially in heteromeric complexes with structurally diverse constituent proteins, are not well understood. Here we investigate how two chemically distinct compounds, glibenclamide and carbamazepine, correct biogenesis defects in {ATP}-sensitive potassium ({KATP}) channels composed of sulfonylurea receptor 1 ({SUR}1) and Kir6.2. We present evidence that despite structural differences, carbamazepine and glibenclamide compete for binding to {KATP} channels, and both drugs share a binding pocket in {SUR}1 to exert their effects. Moreover, both compounds engage Kir6.2, in particular the distal N terminus of Kir6.2, which is involved in normal channel biogenesis, for their chaperoning effects on {SUR}1 mutants. Conversely, both drugs can correct channel biogenesis defects caused by Kir6.2 mutations in a {SUR}1-dependent manner. Using an unnatural, photocross-linkable amino acid, azidophenylalanine, genetically encoded in Kir6.2, we demonstrate in living cells that both drugs promote interactions between the distal N terminus of Kir6.2 and {SUR}1. These findings reveal a converging pharmacological chaperoning mechanism wherein glibenclamide and carbamazepine stabilize the heteromeric subunit interface critical for channel biogenesis to overcome defective biogenesis caused by mutations in individual subunits.},

In the absence of {ATP}, {ADP} opened K({ATP}) channels at concentrations as low as 10 μm and as high as 500 μm, with maximal activation between 10 and 100 μm {ADP} in mouse beta-cell membrane patches. At concentrations greater than 500 μm, {ADP} inhibited K({ATP}) channels while 10 mm virtually abolished channel activity. {HIT} cell channels had a similar biphasic response to {ADP} except that more than 1 mm {ADP} was required for inhibition. The channel opening effect of {ADP} required magnesium while channel inhibition did not. Using creatine/creatine phosphate solutions with creatine phosphokinase to fix {ATP} and {ADP} concentrations, we found substantially different K({ATP})-channel activity with solutions having the same {ATP}/{ADP} ratio but different absolute total nucleotide levels. To account for {ATP}-{ADP} competition, we propose a new model of channel-nucleotide interactions with two kinds of {ADP} binding sites regulating the channel. One site specifically binds {MgADP} and increases channel opening. The other, the previously described {ATP} site, binds either {ATP} or {ADP} and decreases channel opening. This model very closely fits the {ADP} concentration-response curve and, when incorporated into a model of beta-cell membrane potential, increasing {ADP} in the 10 and 100 μm range is predicted to compete very effectively with millimolar levels of {ATP} to hyperpolarize beta-cells.},

	abstract = {{ATP}-sensitive K+ channels are gated by intracellular {ATP}, allowing them to couple intermediary metabolism to cellular excitability, whereas the gating mechanism remains unclear. To understand subunit stoichiometry for the {ATP}-dependent channel gating, we constructed tandem-multimeric Kir6.2 channels by selective disruption of the binding or gating mechanism in certain subunits. Stepwise disruptions of channel gating caused graded losses in {ATP} sensitivity and increases in basal Popen, with no effect on maximum {ATP} inhibition. Prevention of {ATP} binding lowered the {ATP} sensitivity and maximum inhibition without affecting basal Popen. The {ATP}-dependent gating required a minimum of two functional subunits. Two adjacent subunits are more favorable for {ATP} binding than two diagonal ones. Subunits showed negative cooperativity in {ATP} binding and positive cooperativity in channel gating. Joint disruptions of the binding and gating mechanisms in the same or alternate subunits of a concatemer revealed that both intra- and intersubunit couplings contributed to channel gating, although the binding-gating coupling preferred the intrasubunit to intersubunit configuration within the C terminus. No such preference was found between the C and N termini. These phenomena are well-described with the operational model used widely for ligand-receptor interactions.},

	abstract = {It is more than 30 years since the advent of the gigaohm seal patch clamp technique, which enabled routine recordings of currents generated by the activity of a single ion channel molecule in its native environment. The muscle nicotinic acetylcholine ({ACh}) receptor ({nAChR}) is one of the best ligand-gated channels for single channel recording because of its sizable conductance, robust expression, and consistent subunit composition, both at the native neuromuscular junction and in heterologous expression systems. A specific application of single channel recording is kinetic analysis, the purpose of which is to understand how a channel activates in response to an appropriate stimulus. In a recent issue of The Journal of General Physiology, Mukhtasimova et al. report on their kinetic analysis of {nAChR} recordings at substantially improved temporal resolution. We shall discuss the implications of this achievement for our knowledge of how these ligand-gated channels work. In brief, the major findings confirm that there is a short-lived preopening conformation of the receptor, followed by the actual opening, and that partial agonists are partial because of a deficiency in the earlier preopening step.},

A difference in affinity for ligands in the two states influences the C↔O “gating” equilibrium constant. The energies associated with adult-type mouse neuromuscular nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ({AChR}) channel gating have been measured by using single-channel electrophysiology. Without ligands, the free energy, enthalpy and entropy of gating are ΔG0=+8.4, ΔH0=+10.9 and {TΔS}0=+2.5kcal/mol (−100mV, 23°C). Many mutations throughout the protein change ΔG0, including natural ones that cause disease. Agonists and most mutations change approximately independently the ground-state energy difference; thus, it is possible to forecast and engineer {AChR} responses simply by combining perturbations. The free energy of the low↔high affinity change for the neurotransmitter at each of two functionally equivalent binding sites is Δ{GBACh}=−5.1kcal/mol. Δ{GBACh} is set mainly by interactions of {ACh} with just three binding site aromatic groups. For a series of structurally related agonists, there is a correlation between the energies of low- and high-affinity binding, which implies that gating commences with the formation of the low-affinity complex. Brief, intermediate states in binding and gating have been detected. Several proposals for the nature of the gating transition-state energy landscape and the isomerization mechanism are discussed.},

For ligand-gated channels, it is challenging to separate ligand binding from channel gating. Here we studied the cyclic adenosine monophosphate ({cAMP})-dependent gating in hyperpolarization-activated {cAMP}-regulated ({HCN}) channel by simultaneously recording channel opening and ligand binding, using the patch-clamp fluorometry technique with a unique fluorescent {cAMP} analog that fluoresces strongly in the hydrophobic binding pocket and exerts regulatory effects on {HCN} channels similar to those imposed by {cAMP}. Corresponding to voltage-dependent channel activation, we observed a robust, close-to-threefold increase in ligand binding, which was more pronounced at subsaturating ligand concentrations than higher concentrations. This observation supported the cyclic allosteric models and indicated that protein allostery can be implemented through differentiating ligand binding affinities between resting and active states. The kinetics of ligand binding largely matched channel activation. However, during channel deactivation, ligand unbinding was slower than channel closing, suggesting a delayed response to membrane potential by the ligand binding machinery. Our results provide what we believe to be new insights into the {cAMP}-dependent gating in {HCN} channel and the interpretation of protein allostery for general ligand-gated channels and receptors.},

Structurally, {CNG} channels are heterotetramers composed of either two or three homologue subunits1,2,3,4. Although it is well established that activation is a cooperative process of these subunits5, it remains unknown whether the cooperativity is generated by the ligand binding, the gating, or both, and how the subunits interact. In this study, the action of homotetrameric olfactory-type {CNGA}2 channels6 was studied in inside-out membrane patches by simultaneously determining channel activation and ligand binding, using the fluorescent {cGMP} analogue 8-{DY}547-{cGMP} as the ligand. At concentrations of 8-{DY}547-{cGMP} {\textless} 1 μM, steady-state binding was larger than steady-state activation, whereas at higher concentrations it was smaller, generating a crossover of the steady-state relationships. Global analysis of these relationships together with multiple activation time courses following {cGMP} jumps7 showed that four ligands bind to the channels and that there is significant interaction between the binding sites. Among the binding steps, the second is most critical for channel opening: its association constant is three orders of magnitude smaller than the others and it triggers a switch from a mostly closed to a maximally open state. These results contribute to unravelling the role of the subunits in the cooperative mechanism of {CNGA}2 channel activation and could be of general relevance for the action of other ion channels and receptors.},

Among the natural amino acids, tryptophan exhibits the most pronounced quenching efficiency. Especially, the red-absorbing dyes {ATTO} 655, {ATTO} 680, and the oxazine derivative {MR} 121 are strongly quenched almost exclusively by tryptophan due to the formation of weak or nonfluorescent ground-state complexes with association constants, Kass., ranging from 96 to 206 M-1. Rhodamine, fluorescein, and bora-diaza-indacene derivatives that absorb at shorter wavelengths are also quenched substantially by tyrosine residues.

While quenching of {ATTO} 655, {ATTO} 680, and the oxazine derivative {MR}121 by tryptophan is dominated by static quenching, dynamic quenching is more efficient for the two bora-diaza-indacene dyes Bodipy-{FL} and Bodipy630/650. Labeling of the dyes to tryptophan, tryptophan-containing peptides, and proteins (streptavidin) demonstrates that knowledge of these fluorescence quenching processes is crucial for the development of fluorescence-based diagnostic assays.

            Positively-charged amino acids respond to membrane potential changes to drive voltage sensor movement in voltage-gated ion channels, but determining the trajectory of voltage sensor gating charges has proven difficult. We optically tracked the movement of the two most extracellular charged residues (R1, R2) in the Shaker potassium channel voltage sensor using a fluorescent positively-charged bimane derivative ({qBBr}) that is strongly quenched by tryptophan. By individually mutating residues to tryptophan within the putative trajectory of gating charges, we observed that the charge pathway during activation is a rotation and a tilted translation that differs between R1 and R2 and is distinct from their deactivation pathway. Tryptophan-induced quenching of {qBBr} also indicates that a crucial residue of the hydrophobic plug is linked to the Cole-Moore shift through its interaction with R1. Finally, we show that this approach extends to additional voltage-sensing membrane proteins using the
            Ciona intestinalis

In our experiments, we used 21 consecutive single-cysteine substitution mutants in T4 lysozyme (residues T115−K135), located in a helix−turn−helix motif. The mutants were labeled with the fluorescent probe monobromobimane and subjected to an array of fluorescence measurements. Thermal stability measurements show that introduction of the label is substantially perturbing only when it is located at buried residue sites. At buried sites (solvent surface accessibility of {\textless}40 Å2), the destabilizations are between 3 and 5.5 kcal/mol, whereas at more exposed sites, ΔΔG values of ≤1.5 kcal/mol are obtained. Of all the fluorescence parameters that were explored (excitation λmax, emission λmax, fluorescence lifetime, quantum yield, and steady-state anisotropy), the emission λmax and the steady-state anisotropy values most accurately reflect the solvent surface accessibility at each site as calculated from the crystal structure of cysteine-less T4 lysozyme. The parameters we identify allow the classification of each site as buried, partially buried, or exposed. We find that the variations in these parameters as a function of residue number reflect the sequence-specific secondary structure, the determination of which is a key step for modeling a protein of unknown structure.},

	abstract = {Studying the interplay between protein structure and function remains a daunting task. Especially lacking are methods for measuring structural changes in real time. Here we report our most recent improvements to a method that can be used to address such questions. This method, which we now call Tryptophan induced quenching ({TrIQ}), provides a straightforward, sensitive and inexpensive way to address questions of conformational dynamics and short-range protein interactions. Importantly, {TrIQ} only occurs over relatively short distances ({\textasciitilde}5 to 15 Å), making it complementary to traditional fluorescence resonance energy transfer ({FRET}) methods that occur over distances too large for precise studies of protein structure. As implied in the name, {TrIQ} measures the efficient quenching induced in some fluorophores by tryptophan (Trp). We present here our analysis of the {TrIQ} effect for five different fluorophores that span a range of sizes and spectral properties. Each probe was attached to four different cysteine residues on T4 lysozyme and the extent of {TrIQ} caused by a nearby Trp was measured. Our results show that for smaller probes, {TrIQ} is distance dependent. Moreover, we also demonstrate how {TrIQ} data can be analyzed to determine the fraction of fluorophores involved in a static, non-fluorescent complex with Trp. Based on this analysis, our study shows that each fluorophore has a different {TrIQ} profile, or "sphere of quenching", which correlates with its size, rotational flexibility, and the length of attachment linker. This {TrIQ}-based "sphere of quenching" is unique to every Trp-probe pair and reflects the distance within which one can expect to see the {TrIQ} effect. It provides a straightforward, readily accessible approach for mapping distances within proteins and monitoring conformational changes using fluorescence spectroscopy.},

	abstract = {Fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy are non-destructive methods that provide real-time measurements of ion channel structural dynamics. As such, they constitute a direct path linking the high-resolution structural models from X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy with the high-resolution functional data from ionic current measurements. The utility of fluorescence as a reporter of channel structure is limited by the palette of available fluorophores. Thiol-reactive fluorophores are small and bright, but are restricted in terms of the positions on a protein that can be labeled and present significant issues with background incorporation. Genetically encoded fluorescent protein tags are specific to a protein of interest, but are very large and usually only used to label the free N- and C-termini of proteins. L-3-(6-acetylnaphthalen-2-ylamino)-2-aminopropionic acid ({ANAP}) is a fluorescent amino acid that can be specifically incorporated into virtually any site on a protein of interest using amber stop-codon suppression. Due to its environmental sensitivity and potential as a donor in fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments, it has been adopted by numerous investigators to study voltage, ligand, and temperature-dependent activation of a host of ion channels. Simultaneous measurements of ionic currents and {ANAP} fluorescence yield exceptional mechanistic insights into channel function. In this chapter, I will summarize the current literature regarding {ANAP} and ion channels and discuss the practical aspects of using {ANAP}, including potential pitfalls and confounds.},

During channel activation, a stretch of at least seven amino acids of the putative transmembrane segment S4 moved from a buried position into the extracellular environment.

The structures of many ion channels and transporters that were previously recalcitrant to crystallography have now been solved. Yet, despite having atomistic models of many complexes, some in multiple conformations, it has been challenging to glean mechanistic insight from these structures. To some extent this reflects our inability to unambiguously assign a given structure to a particular physiological state. One approach that may allow us to bridge this gap between structure and function is voltage clamp fluorometry ({VCF}). Using this technique, dynamic conformational changes can be measured while simultaneously monitoring the functional state of the channel or transporter. Many of the important papers that have used {VCF} to probe the gating mechanisms of channels and transporters have been published in the Journal of General Physiology. In this review, we provide an overview of the development of {VCF} and discuss some of the key problems that have been addressed using this approach. We end with a brief discussion of the outlook for this technique in the era of high-resolution structures.},

We report the results of a random insertion of {YFP} and {CFP} into multiple sites of the α subunit of the hslo channel using a Tn5 transposon-based technique. 55 unique fluorescent fusion proteins were obtained and tested for cell surface expression and channel function. 19 constructs are expressed at the plasma membrane and show voltage and Ca2+-dependent currents. In 16 of them the voltage and Ca2+ dependence is very similar to the wild-type channel. Two insertions in the Ca2+ bowl and one in the {RCK}2 domain showed a strong shift in the G-V curve. The remaining 36 constructs were retained intracellularly; a solubility assay suggests that these proteins are not forming intracellular aggregates.

Although voltage-clamp fluorometry fills this gap, it is limited to sites extracellularly accessible, when the key region for gating is located at the cytosolic side of the channels. Here, we solved this problem by performing voltage-clamp fluorometry with a fluorescent unnatural amino acid. By using an orthogonal {tRNA}-synthetase pair, the fluorescent unnatural amino acid was incorporated in the Shaker voltage-gated potassium channel at key regions that were previously inaccessible. Thus, we defined which parts act independently and which parts act cooperatively and found pore opening to occur in two sequential transitions.},

The activity of these channels is controlled by both membrane voltage and the ligand {cAMP}, binding to each of the four channel subunits. The molecular mechanism underlying channel activation and the relationship between the two activation stimuli are still unknown. Using patch-clamp fluorometry and a fluorescent {cAMP} analog, we show that full ligand-induced activation appears already with only two ligands bound to the tetrameric channel. Kinetic analysis of channel activation and ligand binding suggests direct interaction between the voltage sensor and the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain, bypassing the pore. By exploiting the duality of activation in {HCN}2 channels by voltage and ligand binding, we quantify the increase of the binding affinity and overall free energy for binding upon channel activation, proving thus the principle of reciprocity between ligand binding and conformational change in a receptor protein.},

The channels are activated by hyperpolarizing voltage but are also receptors for the intracellular ligand adenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate ({cAMP}) that enhances activation but is unable to activate the channels alone. Using {fcAMP}, a fluorescent derivative of {cAMP}, we analyzed the effect of ligand binding on {HCN}2 channels not preactivated by voltage. We identified a conformational flip of the channel as an intermediate state following the ligand binding and quantified it kinetically. Globally fitting the time courses of ligand binding and unbinding revealed modest cooperativity among the subunits in the conformational flip. The intensity of this cooperativity, however, was only moderate compared to channels preactivated by hyperpolarizing voltage. These data provide kinetic information about conformational changes proceeding in nonactivated {HCN}2 channels when {cAMP} binds.

It is well established that glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is associated with the appearance of electrical activity in the beta-cell1,2; glucose concentrations above the threshold level for insulin release produce a slow membrane depolarization followed by either oscillatory bursts of action potentials (5–15 {mM} glucose) or continuous spiking ({\textgreater}16mM glucose). Tracer flux studies3 and microelectrode measurements using intact islets of Langerhans4 have indicated that the initial depolarization induced by glucose is caused by a decrease in the resting membrane permeability to potassium. Evidence also suggests that the electrical5, ionic6 and secretory responses7,8 to glucose are mediated by the metabolism of the sugar within the beta-cell. By using cell-attached membrane patches9 from isolated rat pancreatic beta-cells, we have now identified a potassium channel (G-channel) that is active at the resting potential and is inhibited by glucose. Closure of this channel requires glucose metabolism. This is the first report of a potassium channel whose activity is modulated by glucose, and which may couple metabolic and ionic events involved in the secretion of insulin.},

	abstract = {Pancreatic islets of {NMRI} mice were dissociated into single cells which were kept in tissue culture for 1-3 days. The whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique was used to study inward and delayed outward currents of beta-cells under voltage-clamp conditions at 20-22 degrees C. Outward currents were suppressed by substituting the impermeant cation N-methyl-D-glucamine for intracellular K+. The remaining inward current had a V-shaped current-voltage relation reaching a peak value of 39 +/- 4 {pA} (mean +/- S.E. of mean) around -15 {mV}. It was identified as a Ca2+ current, because the peak amplitude was increased 1.6 times by increasing external [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]o) from 2.6 {mM} to 10 {mM} and it was blocked by Co2+ (5 {mM}) or nifedipine (5 {microM}) but not by {TTX} (20 {microM}). The activation time constant of the inward current at -10 {mV} was 1.28 +/- 0.08 ms. The relation between the degree of activation (estimated from the size of the tail currents) and membrane potential V followed the sigmoidal function f = 1/(1 + exp [(Vh-V)/k]) with half-maximal activation potential, Vh = 4 +/- 1 {mV} and slope factor, k = 14 +/- 1 {mV} (for [Ca2+]o 10 {mM}). The inward current inactivated only weakly during depolarizing pulses of 0.1-1 s duration. The delayed outward current (in experiments with 155 {mM}-internal [K+] ([K+]i)) had a linear voltage dependence at potentials above -20 {mV}; its amplitude at -10 {mV} was 210 +/- 30 {pA}. Tail currents related to the activation of the outward current had K+-dependent reversal potentials. The current was blocked by extracellularly applied tetraethylammonium (20 {mM}) and 4-aminopyridine (2 {mM}). It was not affected by glibenclamide (3 {microM}), tolbutamide (0.2 {mM}) and alterations of intracellular [Ca2+] (1 {nM}-1 {microM}). The activation time constant of the outward current at -10 {mV} was 21 +/- 3 ms. The voltage dependence of activation could be described by the sigmoidal function (see above) with Vh = 19 +/- 1 {mV} and k = 5.6 +/- 0.4 {mV}. The outward current inactivated during long (15 s) depolarizing pre-pulses (time constant at -10 {mV}: 2.6 +/- 0.6 s). 50\% inactivation occurred at Vh = -36 +/- 2 {mV}, k was -4.1 +/- 0.2 {mV}. Inward and outward currents during depolarizing voltage pulses in beta-cells are similar to Ca2+ and delayed K+ currents in other cell types. These currents seem sufficient to generate the action potentials of the beta-cell.},

A number of new studies have pointed to the potential for conversion of non-beta islet cells in to insulin-producing beta-cells to replenish beta-cell mass as a means to treat diabetes. Understanding normal islet cell mass and function is important to help advance such treatment modalities: what should be the target islet/beta-cell mass, does islet architecture matter to energy homeostasis, and what may happen if we lose a particular population of islet cells in favour of beta-cells? These are all questions to which we will need answers for islet replacement therapy by transdifferentiation of non-beta islet cells to be a reality in humans. We know a fair amount about the biology of beta-cells but not quite as much about the other islet cell types. Until recently, we have not had a good grasp of islet mass and distribution in the human pancreas. In this review, we will look at current data on islet cells, focussing more on non-beta cells, and on human pancreatic islet mass and distribution.},

We demonstrate direct modulation by {PIP}2 of {KirBac}1.1 but not {KcsA} activity. In marked contrast to activation of eukaryotic Kir channels by {PIP}2, {KirBac}1.1 is inhibited by {PIP}2 incorporated in the membrane (K½ = 0.3 mol \%). The dependence of inhibition on the number of phosphate groups and requirement for a lipid tail matches that for activation of eukaryotic Kir channels, suggesting a fundamentally similar interaction mechanism.

	abstract = {{ABC} ({ATP}-binding cassette) proteins constitute a large family of membrane proteins that actively transport a broad range of substrates. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ({CFTR}), the protein dysfunctional in cystic fibrosis, is unique among {ABC} proteins in that its transmembrane domains comprise an ion channel. Opening and closing of the pore have been linked to {ATP} binding and hydrolysis at {CFTR}'s two nucleotide-binding domains, {NBD}1 and {NBD}2 (see, for example, refs 1, 2). Isolated {NBDs} of prokaryotic {ABC} proteins dimerize upon binding {ATP}, and hydrolysis of the {ATP} causes dimer dissociation3,4,5. Here, using single-channel recording methods on intact {CFTR} molecules, we directly follow opening and closing of the channel gates, and relate these occurrences to {ATP}-mediated events in the {NBDs}. We find that energetic coupling6 between two {CFTR} residues, expected to lie on opposite sides of its predicted {NBD}1–{NBD}2 dimer interface, changes in concert with channel gating status. The two monitored side chains are independent of each other in closed channels but become coupled as the channels open. The results directly link {ATP}-driven tight dimerization of {CFTR}'s cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domains to opening of the ion channel in the transmembrane domains. This establishes a molecular mechanism, involving dynamic restructuring of the {NBD} dimer interface, that is probably common to all members of the {ABC} protein superfamily.},

The narrow selectivity filter is only 12 angstroms long, whereas the remainder of the pore is wider and lined with hydrophobic amino acids. A large water-filled cavity and helix dipoles are positioned so as to overcome electrostatic destabilization of an ion in the pore at the center of the bilayer. Main chain carbonyl oxygen atoms from the K+ channel signature sequence line the selectivity filter, which is held open by structural constraints to coordinate K+ ions but not smaller Na+ ions. The selectivity filter contains two K+ ions about 7.5 angstroms apart. This configuration promotes ion conduction by exploiting electrostatic repulsive forces to overcome attractive forces between K+ ions and the selectivity filter. The architecture of the pore establishes the physical principles underlying selective K+ conduction.},

	abstract = {Remarkable advances have been made toward the structural characterization of ion channels in the last two decades. However, the unambiguous assignment of well-defined functional states to the obtained structural models has proved challenging. In the case of the superfamily of nicotinic-receptor channels (also referred to as pentameric ligand-gated ion channels [{pLGICs}]), for example, two different types of model of the open-channel conformation have been proposed on the basis of structures solved to resolutions better than 4.0 Å. At the level of the transmembrane pore, the open-state models of the proton-gated {pLGIC} from Gloeobacter violaceus ({GLIC}) and the invertebrate glutamate-gated Cl– channel ({GluCl}) are very similar to each other, but that of the glycine receptor ({GlyR}) is considerably wider. Indeed, the mean distances between the axis of ion permeation and the Cα atoms at the narrowest constriction of the pore (position −2′) differ by ∼2 Å in these two classes of model, a large difference when it comes to understanding the physicochemical bases of ion conduction and charge selectivity. Here, we take advantage of the extreme open-channel stabilizing effect of mutations at pore-facing position 9′. We find that the I9′A mutation slows down entry into desensitization of {GLIC} to the extent that macroscopic currents decay only slightly by the end of {pH} 4.5 solution applications to the extracellular side for several minutes. We crystallize (at {pH} 4.5) two variants of {GLIC} carrying this mutation and solve their structures to resolutions of 3.12 Å and 3.36 Å. Furthermore, we perform all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of ion permeation and picrotoxinin block, using the different open-channel structural models. On the basis of these results, we favor the notion that the open-channel structure of {pLGICs} from animals is much closer to that of the narrow models (of {GLIC} and {GluCl}) than it is to that of the {GlyR}.},

However, it might be the case that many different combinations of model parameters can explain the observations equally well. In these cases, the model parameters are not identifiable: the experimentation has not provided sufficient constraining power to enable unique estimation of their true values. We demonstrate that this pitfall is present even in simple biophysical models. We investigate the underlying causes of parameter non-identifiability and discuss straightforward methods for determining when parameters of simple models can be inferred accurately. However, for models of even modest complexity, more general tools are required to diagnose parameter non-identifiability. We present a method based in Bayesian inference that can be used to establish the reliability of parameter estimates, as well as yield accurate quantification of parameter confidence.},

	abstract = {Excitation-evoked calcium influx across cellular membranes is strictly controlled by voltage-gated calcium channels ({CaV}), which possess four distinct voltage-sensing domains ({VSDs}) that direct the opening of a central pore. The energetic interactions between the {VSDs} and the pore are critical for tuning the channel’s voltage dependence. The accessory α2δ-1 subunit is known to facilitate {CaV}1.2 voltage-dependent activation, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. In this study, using voltage clamp fluorometry, we track the activation of the four individual {VSDs} in a human L-type {CaV}1.2 channel consisting of α1C and beta3 subunits. We find that, without α2δ-1, the channel complex displays a right-shifted voltage dependence such that currents mainly develop at nonphysiological membrane potentials because of very weak {VSD}–pore interactions. The presence of α2δ-1 facilitates channel activation by increasing the voltage sensitivity (i.e., the effective charge) of {VSDs} I–{III}. Moreover, the α2δ-1 subunit also makes {VSDs} I–{III} more efficient at opening the channel by increasing the coupling energy between {VSDs} {II} and {III} and the pore, thus allowing Ca influx within the range of physiological membrane potentials.},

	abstract = {We consider the Bayesian analysis of mechanistic models describing the dynamic behavior of ligand-gated ion channels. The opening of the transmembrane pore in an ion channel is brought about by conformational changes in the protein, which results in a flow of ions through the pore. Remarkably, given the diameter of the pore, the flow of ions from a small number of channels or indeed from a single ion channel molecule can be recorded experimentally. This produces a large time-series of high-resolution experimental data, which can be used to investigate the gating process of these channels. We give a brief overview of the achievements and limitations of alternative maximum-likelihood approaches to this type of modeling, before investigating the statistical issues associated with analyzing stochastic model reaction mechanisms from a Bayesian perspective. Finally, we compare a number of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms that may be used to tackle this challenging inference problem.},

	abstract = {Understanding the interactions of proteins with their ligands requires knowledge of molecular properties, such as binding site affinities and the effects that binding at one site exerts on binding at other sites (cooperativity). These properties cannot be measured directly and are usually estimated by fitting binding data with models that contain these quantities as parameters. In this study, we present a general method for answering the critical question of whether these parameters are identifiable (i.e., whether their estimates are accurate and unique). In cases in which parameter estimates are not unique, our analysis provides insight into the fundamental causes of nonidentifiability. This approach can thus serve as a guide for the proper design and analysis of protein–ligand binding experiments. We show that the equilibrium total binding relation can be reduced to a conserved mathematical form for all models composed solely of bimolecular association reactions and to a related, conserved form for all models composed of arbitrary combinations of binding and conformational equilibria. This canonical mathematical structure implies a universal parameterization of the binding relation that is consistent with virtually any physically reasonable binding model, for proteins with any number of binding sites. Matrix algebraic methods are used to prove that these universal parameter sets are structurally identifiable ({SI}; i.e., identifiable under conditions of noiseless data). A general approach for assessing and understanding the factors governing practical identifiability (i.e., the identifiability under conditions of real, noisy data) of these {SI} parameter sets is presented in the companion paper by Middendorf and Aldrich (2017.

Here, we show that {NALCN} encodes a current that is activated by M3 muscarinic receptors (M3R) in a pancreatic ?-cell line. This current is primarily permeant to sodium ions, independent of intracellular calcium stores and G proteins but dependent on Src activation, and resistant to {TTX}. The current is recapitulated by co-expression of {NALCN} and M3R in human embryonic kidney-293 cells and in Xenopus oocytes. We also show that {NALCN} and M3R belong to the same protein complex, involving the intracellular I?{II} loop of {NALCN} and the intracellular i3 loop of M3R. Taken together, our data show the molecular basis of a muscarinic-activated inward sodium current that is independent of G-protein activation, and provide new insights into the properties of {NALCN} channels.},

The C-terminus of {UNC}80 contains a domain that interacts with {UNC}79 and overcomes a soma-retention signal to achieve dendritic localization. {UNC}80 lacking this domain, as found in human patients, still supports whole-cell {NALCN} currents but lacks dendritic localization. Our results establish the subunit composition of the {NALCN} complex, uncover the inter-subunit interaction domains, reveal the functional significance of regulation of dendritic membrane potential by the sodium-leak channel complex, and provide evidence supporting that genetic variations found in individuals with intellectual disability are the causes for the phenotype observed in patients.},

However, the basic functional and pharmacological properties of {NALCN} have remained elusive. Here, we found that robust function of {NALCN} in heterologous systems requires co-expression of {UNC}79, {UNC}80, and {FAM}155A. The resulting {NALCN} channel complex is constitutively active and conducts monovalent cations but is blocked by physiological concentrations of extracellular divalent cations. Our data support the notion that {NALCN} is directly responsible for the increased excitability observed in a variety of neurons in reduced extracellular Ca2+. Despite the smaller number of voltage-sensing residues in {NALCN}, the constitutive activity is modulated by voltage, suggesting that voltage-sensing domains can give rise to a broader range of gating phenotypes than previously anticipated. Our work points toward formerly unknown contributions of {NALCN} to neuronal excitability and opens avenues for pharmacological targeting.

	abstract = {The excitability of neurons is tightly dependent on their ion channel repertoire. Among these channels, the leak sodium channel {NALCN} plays a crucial role in the maintenance of the resting membrane potential. Importantly, {NALCN} mutations lead to complex neurodevelopmental syndromes, including infantile hypotonia with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies ({IHPRF}) and congenital contractures of limbs and face, hypotonia and developmental delay ({CLIFAHDD}), which are recessively and dominantly inherited, respectively. Unfortunately, the biophysical properties of {NALCN} are still largely unknown to date, as well as the functional consequences of both {IHPRF} and {CLIFAHDD} mutations on {NALCN} current. Here we have set-up the heterologous expression of {NALCN} in the neuronal cell line {NG}108-15 to investigate the electrophysiological properties of {NALCN} carrying representative {IHPRF} and {CLIFAHDD} mutations. Several original properties of the wild-type (wt) {NALCN} current were retrieved: mainly carried by external Na+, blocked by Gd3+, insensitive to {TTX} and potentiated by low external Ca2+ concentration. However, we found that this current displays a time-dependent inactivation in the −80/−40 {mV} range of membrane potential, and a non linear current-voltage relationship indicative of voltage sensitivity. Importantly, no detectable current was recorded with the {IHPRF} missense mutation p.Trp1287Leu (W1287L), while the {CLIFAHDD} mutants, p.Leu509Ser (L509S) and p.Tyr578Ser (Y578S), showed higher current densities and slower inactivation, compared to wt {NALCN} current. This study reveals that heterologous expression of {NALCN} channel can be achieved in the neuronal cell line {NG}108-15 to study the electrophysiological properties of wt and mutants. From our results, we conclude that {IHPRF} and {CLIFAHDD} missense mutations are loss- and gain-of-function variants, respectively.},

	abstract = {Ion channels are crucial components of cellular excitability and are involved in many neurological diseases. This review focuses on the sodium leak, G protein-coupled receptors ({GPCRs})-activated {NALCN} channel that is predominantly expressed in neurons where it regulates the resting membrane potential and neuronal excitability. {NALCN} is part of a complex that includes not only {GPCRs}, but also {UNC}-79, {UNC}-80, {NLF}-1 and src family of Tyrosine kinases ({SFKs}). There is growing evidence that the {NALCN} channelosome critically regulates its ion conduction. Both in mammals and invertebrates, animal models revealed an involvement in many processes such as locomotor behaviours, sensitivity to volatile anesthetics, and respiratory rhythms. There is also evidence that alteration in this {NALCN} channelosome can cause a wide variety of diseases. Indeed, mutations in the {NALCN} gene were identified in Infantile Neuroaxonal Dystrophy ({INAD}) patients, as well as in patients with an Autosomal Recessive Syndrome with severe hypotonia, speech impairment, and cognitive delay. Deletions in {NALCN} gene were also reported in diseases such as 13q syndrome. In addition, genes encoding {NALCN}, {NLF}- 1, {UNC}-79 and {UNC}-80 proteins may be susceptibility loci for several diseases including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, autism, epilepsy, alcoholism, cardiac diseases and cancer. Although the physiological role of the {NALCN} channelosome is poorly understood, its involvement in human diseases should foster interest for drug development in the near future. Towards this goal, we review here the current knowledge on the {NALCN} channelosome in physiology and diseases.},

Dysfunctions of the {NALCN} channelosome, {NALCN} with several auxiliary subunits, are associated with a variety of human diseases. Here, we report the cryo-{EM} structure of human {NALCN} in complex with {FAM}155A at an overall resolution of 3.1 angstroms. {FAM}155A forms extensive interactions with the extracellular loops of {NALCN} that may help stabilize {NALCN} in the membrane. A Na+ ion-binding site, reminiscent of a Ca2+ binding site in Cav channels, is identified in the unique {EEKE} selectivity filter. Despite its ‘leaky’ nature, the channel is closed and the intracellular gate is sealed by S6I, {II}-{III} linker and {III}-{IV} linker.

	abstract = {Resting membrane potential determines the excitability of the cell and is essential for the cellular electrical activities. The {NALCN} channel mediates sodium leak currents, which positively adjust resting membrane potential towards depolarization. The {NALCN} channel is involved in several neurological processes and has been implicated in a spectrum of neurodevelopmental diseases. Here, we report the cryo-{EM} structure of rat {NALCN} and mouse {FAM}155A complex to 2.7 Å resolution. The structure reveals detailed interactions between {NALCN} and the extracellular cysteine-rich domain of {FAM}155A. We find that the non-canonical architecture of {NALCN} selectivity filter dictates its sodium selectivity and calcium block, and that the asymmetric arrangement of two functional voltage sensors confers the modulation by membrane potential. Moreover, mutations associated with human diseases map to the domain-domain interfaces or the pore domain of {NALCN}, intuitively suggesting their pathological mechanisms.},

The ion channel responsible for the major background Na+ conductance in neurons is the Na+ leak channel, non-selective ({NALCN})3,4. {NALCN}-mediated currents regulate neuronal excitability linked to respiration, locomotion and circadian rhythm4–10. {NALCN} activity is under tight regulation11–14 and mutations in {NALCN} cause severe neurological disorders and early death15,16. {NALCN} is an orphan channel in humans, and fundamental aspects of channel assembly, gating, ion selectivity and pharmacology remain obscure. Here we investigate this essential leak channel and determined the structure of {NALCN} in complex with a distinct auxiliary subunit, family with sequence similarity 155 member A ({FAM}155A). {FAM}155A forms an extracellular dome that shields the ion-selectivity filter from neurotoxin attack. The pharmacology of {NALCN} is further delineated by a walled-off central cavity with occluded lateral pore fenestrations. Unusual voltage-sensor domains with asymmetric linkages to the pore suggest mechanisms by which {NALCN} activity is modulated. We found a tightly closed pore gate in {NALCN} where the majority of missense patient mutations cause gain-of-function phenotypes that cluster around the S6 gate and distinctive π-bulges. Our findings provide a framework to further study the physiology of {NALCN} and a foundation for discovery of treatments for {NALCN} channelopathies and other electrical disorders.},

	abstract = {Freeman-Sheldon syndrome, or distal arthrogryposis type 2A ({DA}2A), is an autosomal-dominant condition caused by mutations in {MYH}3 and characterized by multiple congenital contractures of the face and limbs and normal cognitive development. We identified a subset of five individuals who had been putatively diagnosed with “{DA}2A with severe neurological abnormalities” and for whom congenital contractures of the limbs and face, hypotonia, and global developmental delay had resulted in early death in three cases; this is a unique condition that we now refer to as {CLIFAHDD} syndrome. Exome sequencing identified missense mutations in the sodium leak channel, non-selective ({NALCN}) in four families affected by {CLIFAHDD} syndrome. We used molecular-inversion probes to screen for {NALCN} in a cohort of 202 distal arthrogryposis ({DA})-affected individuals as well as concurrent exome sequencing of six other {DA}-affected individuals, thus revealing {NALCN} mutations in ten additional families with “atypical” forms of {DA}. All 14 mutations were missense variants predicted to alter amino acid residues in or near the S5 and S6 pore-forming segments of {NALCN}, highlighting the functional importance of these segments. In vitro functional studies demonstrated that {NALCN} alterations nearly abolished the expression of wild-type {NALCN}, suggesting that alterations that cause {CLIFAHDD} syndrome have a dominant-negative effect. In contrast, homozygosity for mutations in other regions of {NALCN} has been reported in three families affected by an autosomal-recessive condition characterized mainly by hypotonia and severe intellectual disability. Accordingly, mutations in {NALCN} can cause either a recessive or dominant condition characterized by varied though overlapping phenotypic features, perhaps based on the type of mutation and affected protein domain(s).},

Here, we report three patients with neurodevelopmental disease and hypotonia, harboring one recurrent (p.R1181Q) and two novel mutations (p.L312V and p.V1020F) occurring de novo in {NALCN}. Mutation p.L312 is located in the pore forming S6 region of domain I and p.V1020F in the S5 region of domain {III}. Mutation p.R1181Q is in a linker region. Mapping these three mutations to a model of {NALCN} showed p.Leu312 and p.Val1020 positioned in the hydrophobic core of the pore modules, indicating these two mutations may affect the gating function of {NALCN}. Although p.R1181Q is unlikely to affect the ion channel structure, previous studies have shown that an analogous mutation in Caenorhabditis elegans produced a phenotype with a coiling locomotion, suggesting that p.R1181Q could also affect {NALCN} function. Our three patients showed profound intellectual disability and growth delay, facial dysmorphologies and hypotonia.

It is part of a large ion channel complex, the “{NALCN} channelosome”, consisting of multiple proteins including {UNC}80 and {UNC}79. The predominant neuronal expression pattern and its function suggest an important role in neuronal function and disease. So far, biallelic {NALCN} and {UNC}80 variants have been described in a small number of individuals leading to infantile hypotonia, psychomotor retardation, and characteristic facies 1 ({IHPRF}1, {OMIM} 615419) and 2 ({IHPRF}2, {OMIM} 616801), respectively. Heterozygous de novo {NALCN} missense variants in the S5/S6 pore-forming segments lead to congenital contractures of the limbs and face, hypotonia, and developmental delay ({CLIFAHDD}, {OMIM} 616266) with some clinical overlap. In this study, we present detailed clinical information of 16 novel individuals with biallelic {NALCN} variants, 1 individual with a heterozygous de novo {NALCN} missense variant and an interesting clinical phenotype without contractures, and 12 individuals with biallelic {UNC}80 variants. We report for the first time a missense {NALCN} variant located in the predicted S6 pore-forming unit inherited in an autosomal-recessive manner leading to mild {IHPRF}1. We show evidence of clinical variability, especially among {IHPRF}1-affected individuals, and discuss differences between the {IHPRF}1- and {IHPRF}2 phenotypes. In summary, we provide a comprehensive overview of {IHPRF}1 and {IHPRF}2 phenotypes based on the largest cohort of individuals reported so far and provide additional insights into the clinical phenotypes of these neurodevelopmental diseases to help improve counseling of affected families.},

Here, we reveal a third major effector involved in D2R modulation of dopaminergic neurons - the sodium leak channel, {NALCN}. We found that activation of D2 receptors robustly inhibits isolated sodium leak currents in wild-type mice but not in {NALCN} conditional knockout mice. Intracellular {GDP}-betaS abolished the inhibition, indicating a G protein-dependent signaling mechanism. The application of dopamine reliably slowed pacemaking even when {GIRK} channels were pharmacologically blocked. Furthermore, while spontaneous activity was observed in nearly all dopaminergic neurons in wild-type mice, neurons from {NALCN} knockouts were mainly silent. Both observations demonstrate the critical importance of {NALCN} for pacemaking in dopaminergic neurons. Finally, we show that {GABA}-B receptor activation also produces inhibition of {NALCN}-mediated currents. Therefore, we identify {NALCN} as a core effector of inhibitory G protein-coupled receptors.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose {NALCN} is a Na+ leak, {GPCR}-activated channel that regulates the resting membrane potential and neuronal excitability. Despite numerous possible roles for {NALCN} in both normal physiology and disease processes, lack of specific blockers hampers further investigation. Experimental Approach The effect of N-benzhydryl quinuclidine compounds on {NALCN} channels was demonstrated using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in {HEK}293T cells overexpressing {NALCN} and acutely isolated nigral dopaminergic neurons that express {NALCN} endogenously. Src kinase activity was measured using a Src kinase assay kit, and voltage and current-clamp recordings from nigral dopaminergic neurons were used to measure {NALCN} currents and membrane potentials. Key Results N-benzhydryl quinuclidine compounds inhibited {NALCN} channels without affecting {TRPC} channels, another important route for Na+ leak. In {HEK}293T cells overexpressing {NALCN}, N-benzhydryl quinuclidine compounds potently suppressed muscarinic M3 receptor-activated {NALCN} currents. Structure–function relationship studies suggest that the quinuclidine ring with a benzhydryl group imparts the ability to inhibit {NALCN} currents regardless of Src family kinases. Moreover, N-benzhydryl quinuclidine compounds inhibited not only {GPCR}-activated {NALCN} currents but also background Na+ leak currents and hyperpolarized the membrane potential in native midbrain dopaminergic neurons that express {NALCN} endogenously. Conclusion and Implications These findings suggest that N-benzhydryl quinuclidine compounds have a pharmacological potential to directly inhibit {NALCN} channels and could be a useful tool to investigate functions of {NALCN} channels.},

Because deficiency of sodium leak channel, non-selective (Nalcn) causes lethal apnea in humans and mice, we investigated Nalcn function in these neuronal groups. We found that one-third of mice lacking Nalcn in excitatory {preBötC} neurons died soon after birth; surviving mice developed apneas in adulthood. Interestingly, in both {preBötC} and {RTN} neurons, the Nalcn current influences the resting membrane potential, contributes to maintenance of stable network activity, and mediates modulatory responses to the neuropeptide substance P.

	abstract = {Background Infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy ({INAD}) is a recessive disease that results in total neurological degeneration and death in childhood. {PLA}2G6 mutation is the underlying genetic defect, but rare genetic heterogeneity has been demonstrated. One of the five families we studied did not link to {PLA}2G6 locus, and in the family one of the two affected siblings additionally had atypical features including facial dysmorphism, pectus carinatum, scoliosis, pes varus, zygodactyly and bilateral cryptorchidism as well as cerebellar atrophy, as previously reported.
Methods Sural biopsy was investigated by electron microscopy. {PLA}2G6 was screened for mutations by Sanger sequencing. In the mutation-free family, candidate disease loci were found via linkage analysis using data from single nucleotide polymorphism genome scans. Exome sequencing was applied to find the variants at the loci.
Results {PLA}2G6 mutations were identified in four families including the one with an unusually severe phenotype that led to death within the first 2 years of life. In the remaining family, seven candidate loci totalling 15.2 Mb were found and a homozygous truncating mutation p.Q642X was identified in {NALCN} at 13q32.3. The patients are around 20-years-old.
Conclusions {NALCN} is the gene responsible for {INAD} with facial dysmorphism. The patients have lived to adulthood despite severe growth and neuromotor retardation. {NALCN} forms a voltage-independent ion channel with a role in the regulation of neuronal excitability. Our findings broaden the spectrum of genes associated with neuroaxonal dystrophy. Testing infants with idiopathic severe growth retardation and neurodegeneration for {NALCN} mutations could benefit families.},

	abstract = {{NALCN} is a member of the family of ion channels with four homologous, repeat domains that include voltage-gated calcium and sodium channels. {NALCN} is a highly conserved gene from simple, extant multicellular organisms without nervous systems such as sponges and placozoans and mostly remains a single gene compared to the calcium and sodium channels which diversified into twenty genes in humans. The single {NALCN} gene has alternatively-spliced exons at exons 15 or exon 31 that splices in novel selectivity filter residues that resemble calcium channels ({EEEE}) or sodium channels ({EKEE} or {EEKE}). {NALCN} channels with alternative calcium, ({EEEE}) and sodium, ({EKEE} or {EEKE}) -selective pores are conserved in simple bilaterally symmetrical animals like flatworms to non-chordate deuterostomes. The single {NALCN} gene is limited as a sodium channel with a lysine (K)-containing pore in vertebrates, but originally {NALCN} was a calcium-like channel, and evolved to operate as both a calcium channel and sodium channel for different roles in many invertebrates. Expression patterns of {NALCN}-{EKEE} in pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis suggest roles for {NALCN} in secretion, with an abundant expression in brain, and an up-regulation in secretory organs of sexually-mature adults such as albumen gland and prostate. {NALCN}-{EEEE} is equally abundant as {NALCN}-{EKEE} in snails, but is greater expressed in heart and other muscle tissue, and 50\% less expressed in the brain than {NALCN}-{EKEE}. Transfected snail {NALCN}-{EEEE} and {NALCN}-{EKEE} channel isoforms express in {HEK}-293T cells. We were not able to distinguish potential {NALCN} currents from background, non-selective leak conductances in {HEK}293T cells. Native leak currents without expressing {NALCN} genes in {HEK}-293T cells are {NMDG}+ impermeant and blockable with 10 µM Gd3+ ions and are indistinguishable from the hallmark currents ascribed to mammalian {NALCN} currents expressed in vitro by Lu et al. in Cell. 2007 Apr 20;129(2):371-83.},

Interestingly, her episodes of ataxia were abolished by the administration of acetazolamide, similar to the response observed in episodic ataxia associated with other ion channels. Introducing the analogous mutation in the Caenorhabditis elegans homologue nca-1 induced a coiling locomotion phenotype, identical to that obtained with previously characterized C. elegans gain-of-function nca alleles, suggesting that p.R1181Q confers the same property to {NALCN}. This observation thus suggests that dominant mutations in {NALCN} can cause a neurodevelopmental phenotype that overlaps with, while being mostly distinct from that associated with recessive mutations in the same gene.},

	abstract = {During pregnancy, the uterus transitions from a quiescent state to an excitable, highly contractile state to deliver the fetus. Two important contributors essential for this transition are hormones and ion channels, both of which modulate myometrial smooth muscle cell ({MSMC}) excitability. Recently, the sodium (Na+) leak channel, nonselective ({NALCN}), was shown to contribute to a Na+ leak current in human {MSMCs}, and mice lacking {NALCN} in the uterus had dysfunctional labor. Microarray data suggested that the proquiescent hormone progesterone (P4) and the procontractile hormone estrogen (E2) regulated this channel. Here, we sought to determine whether P4 and E2 directly regulate {NALCN}. In human {MSMCs}, we found that {NALCN} {mRNA} expression decreased by 2.3-fold in the presence of E2 and increased by 5.6-fold in the presence of P4. Similarly, E2 treatment decreased, and P4 treatment restored {NALCN} protein expression. Additionally, E2 significantly inhibited, and P4 significantly enhanced an {NALCN}-dependent leak current in {MSMCs}. Finally, we identified estrogen response and progesterone response elements ({EREs} and {PREs}) in the {NALCN} promoter. With the use of luciferase assays, we showed that the {PREs}, but not the {ERE}, contributed to regulation of {NALCN} expression. Our findings reveal a new mechanism by which {NALCN} is regulated in the myometrium and suggest a novel role for {NALCN} in pregnancy.},

Alternatively spliced pores in invertebrate homologs provide insights into different structural features underlying calcium and sodium selectivity. {NALCN} generates alternative ion selectivity with splicing that changes the high field strength ({HFS}) site at the narrowest juncture of the hourglass shaped pore selectivity filter. {NALCN} splices in a {HFS} site that resembles calcium channels with a ring of glutamates contributed by all four domains ({EEEE}) like in highly calcium selective Cav1 or Cav2 channels, or splices in a lysine (K) residue in the third or second position ({EEKE} or {EKEE}) resembling the sodium selective channels that have primarily either {DEKA} or {DKEA} {HF} sites. Alternative splicing to regulate sodium and calcium ion selectivity in T-type channels involves alternative tri- and penta-cysteine extracellular turrets (S5P) of different lengths. Extracellular turrets of increasing lengths in potassium channels ({KIR}2.2, {hERG}, and K2P1) contribute to a changing landscape above the pore selectivity filter that can limit drug access and serve as an ion pre-filter before ions reach the pore selectivity filter below. T-type channels have an infusion of 4 to 12 extra cysteines in extracellular regions above a core eight cysteines found in most eukaryotic channels. The pattern of conservation suggest a possible pairing of long turrets in Domains I and {III}, which are bridged with core cysteines in {NALCN}, Cav, and Nav channels, and pairing of shorter turrets in Domains {II} and {IV} in T-type channel through disulfide bonds involving specific cysteines. Pairing of extended turrets likely contribute to the large extracellular domain as seen in single particle electron cryo-microscopy images in representative 4x6TM channels.},

	abstract = {The activity of background potassium and sodium channels determines neuronal excitability, but physiological roles for “leak” Na+ channels in specific mammalian neurons have not been established. Here, we show that a leak Na+ channel, Nalcn, is expressed in the {CO}2/H+-sensitive neurons of the mouse retrotrapezoid nucleus ({RTN}) that regulate breathing. In {RTN} neurons, Nalcn expression correlated with higher action potential discharge over a more alkalized range of activity; {shRNA}-mediated depletion of Nalcn hyperpolarized {RTN} neurons, and reduced leak Na+ current and firing rate. Nalcn depletion also decreased {RTN} neuron activation by the neuropeptide, substance P, without affecting {pH}-sensitive background K+ currents or activation by a cotransmitter, serotonin. In vivo, {RTN}-specific knockdown of Nalcn reduced {CO}2-evoked neuronal activation and breathing; hypoxic hyperventilation was unchanged. Thus, Nalcn regulates {RTN} neuronal excitability and stimulation by {CO}2, independent of direct {pH} sensing, potentially contributing to respiratory effects of Nalcn mutations; transmitter modulation of Nalcn may underlie state-dependent changes in breathing and respiratory chemosensitivity.
{SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT} Breathing is an essential, enduring rhythmic motor activity orchestrated by dedicated brainstem circuits that require tonic excitatory drive for their persistent function. A major source of drive is from a group of {CO}2/H+-sensitive neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus ({RTN}), whose ongoing activity is critical for breathing. The ionic mechanisms that support spontaneous activity of {RTN} neurons are unknown. We show here that Nalcn, a unique channel that generates “leak” sodium currents, regulates excitability and neuromodulation of {RTN} neurons and {CO}2-stimulated breathing. Thus, this work defines a specific function for this enigmatic channel in an important physiological context.},

	abstract = {Objective: To perform genotype–phenotype analysis in an infant with congenital arthrogryposis due to a de novo missense mutation in the {NALCN} ion channel and explore the mechanism of pathogenicity using a Caenorhabditis elegans model.
Methods: We performed whole-exome sequencing in a preterm neonate with congenital arthrogryposis and a severe life-threatening clinical course. We examined the mechanism of pathogenicity of the associated {NALCN} mutation by engineering the orthologous mutation into the nematode C elegans using {CRISPR}-Cas9.
Results: We identified a de novo missense mutation in {NALCN}, c.1768C{\textgreater}T, in an infant with a severe neonatal lethal form of the recently characterized {CLIFAHDD} syndrome (congenital contractures of the limbs and face with hypotonia and developmental delay). We report novel phenotypic features including prolonged episodes of stimulus-sensitive sustained muscular contraction associated with life-threatening episodes of desaturation and autonomic instability, extending the severity of previously described phenotypes associated with mutations in {NALCN}. When engineered into the C elegans ortholog, this mutation results in a severe gain-of-function phenotype, with hypercontraction and uncoordinated movement. We engineered 6 additional {CLIFAHDD} syndrome mutations into C elegans and the mechanism of action could be divided into 2 categories: half phenocopied gain-of-function mutants and half phenocopied loss-of-function mutants.
Conclusions: The clinical phenotype of our patient and electrophysiologic studies show sustained muscular contraction in response to transient sensory stimuli. In C elegans, this mutation causes neuronal hyperactivity via a gain-of-function {NALCN} ion channel. Testing human variants of {NALCN} in C elegans demonstrates that {CLIFAHDD} can be caused by dominant loss- or gain-of-function mutations in ion channel function.},

The spontaneously active {GABAergic} neurons of the substantia nigra pars reticulata ({SNr}), a major output of the basal ganglia, provide tonic inhibition of downstream brain areas. A depolarizing 'leak' current supports this firing pattern, but its molecular basis remains poorly understood. To understand how {SNr} neurons maintain tonic activity, we used single-cell {RNA} sequencing to determine the transcriptome of individual mouse {SNr} neurons. We discovered that {SNr} neurons express the sodium leak channel, {NALCN}, and that {SNr} neurons lacking {NALCN} have impaired spontaneous firing. In addition, {NALCN} is involved in the modulation of excitability by changes in glycolysis and by activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Our findings suggest that disruption of {NALCN} could impair the basal ganglia circuit, which may underlie the severe motor deficits in humans carrying mutations in {NALCN}.},

We recently reported that {NALCN} is also expressed in rodent islets of Langerhans as well as in the mouse {MIN}6 pancreatic beta-cell line. This pancreatic {NALCN} channel encodes for a cation current triggered by acetylcholine activation of M3 muscarinic receptors. Importantly, the activation mechanism is independent of G protein action, but is dependent on a {SFK}-pathway, and involves the co-inclusion of M3 muscarinic receptors and {NALCN} in the same complex. Although additional work is now needed, considering the importance of the cholinergic control on the pancreatic beta-cell function, this study has unravelled the molecular identity of a new actor in pancreatic beta-cell excitability that could be a major target for new compounds modulating insulin secretion.},

	abstract = {{NALCN} is an intriguing, orphan ion channel among the 4x6TM family of related voltage-gated cation channels, sharing a common architecture of four homologous domains consisting of six transmembrane helices, separated by three cytoplasmic linkers and delimited by N and C-terminal ends. {NALCN} is one of the shortest 4x6TM family members, lacking much of the variation that provides the diverse palate of gating features, and tissue specific adaptations of sodium and calcium channels. {NALCN}’s most distinctive feature is that that it possesses a highly adaptable pore with a calcium-like {EEEE} selectivity filter in radially symmetrical animals and a more sodium-like {EEKE} or {EKEE} selectivity filter in bilaterally symmetrical animals including vertebrates. Two lineages of animals evolved alternative calcium-like {EEEE} and sodium-like {EEKE} / {EKEE} pores, spliced to regulate {NALCN} functions in differing cellular environments, such as muscle (heart and skeletal) and secretory tissue (brain and glands), respectively. A highly adaptable pore in an otherwise conserved ion channel in the 4x6TM channel family is not consistent with a role for {NALCN} in directly gating a significant ion conductance that can be either sodium ions or calcium ions. {NALCN} was proposed to be an expressible Gd3+-sensitive, {NMDG}+-impermeant, non-selective and ohmic leak conductance in {HEK}-293T cells, but we were unable to distinguish these reported currents from leaky patch currents ({ILP}) in control {HEK}-293T cells. We suggest that {NALCN} functions as a sensor for the much larger {UNC}80/{UNC}79 complex, in a manner consistent with the coupling mechanism known for other weakly or non-conducting 4x6TM channel sensor proteins such as Nax or Cav1.1. We propose that {NALCN} serves as a variable sensor that responds to calcium or sodium ion flux, depending on whether the total cellular current density is generated more from calcium-selective or sodium-selective channels.},

We identified a role for the Caenorhabditis elegans {NALCN} homologues {NCA}-1 and {NCA}-2 in the propagation of neuronal activity from cell bodies to synapses. Loss of {NCA} activities leads to reduced synaptic transmission at neuromuscular junctions and frequent halting in locomotion. In vivo calcium imaging experiments further indicate that while calcium influx in the cell bodies of egg-laying motorneurons is unaffected by altered {NCA} activity, synaptic calcium transients are significantly reduced in nca loss-of-function mutants and increased in nca gain-of-function mutants. {NCA}-1 localizes along axons and is enriched at nonsynaptic regions. Its localization and function depend on {UNC}-79, and {UNC}-80, a novel conserved protein that is also enriched at nonsynaptic regions.

Some gap junction proteins, namely connexins and pannexins in vertebrates, and innexins in invertebrates, may also function as hemichannels. A conserved {NCA}/Dmα1U/{NALCN} family cation leak channel regulates the excitability and activity of vertebrate and invertebrate neurons. In the present study, we describe a genetic and functional interaction between the innexin {UNC}-7 and the cation leak channel {NCA} in Caenorhabditis elegans neurons. While the loss of the neuronal {NCA} channel function leads to a reduced evoked postsynaptic current at neuromuscular junctions, a simultaneous loss of the {UNC}-7 function restores the evoked response. The expression of {UNC}-7 in neurons reverts the effect of the unc-7 mutation; moreover, the expression of {UNC}-7 mutant proteins that are predicted to be unable to form gap junctions also reverts this effect, suggesting that {UNC}-7 innexin regulates neuronal activity, in part, through gap junction-independent functions. We propose that, in addition to gap junction-mediated functions, {UNC}-7 innexin may also form hemichannels to regulate C. elegans' neuronal activity cooperatively with the {NCA} family leak channels.},

A disturbance in this tightly regulated balance will result in either hyponatremia or hypernatremia, which are both common electrolyte disorders in hospitalized patients. Despite the high clinical importance of hypo- and hypernatremia and the fact that this vital process has been studied for many years, the genes and corresponding proteins involved in this process are just beginning to be identified. To identify novel genes involved in the (patho-)physiology of osmoregulation, we therefore employed haplotype association mapping on an aging group of 27 inbred mouse strains. Serum sodium concentrations were determined in all strains at 6, 12, and 18 mo of age, and high-resolution mapping was performed for males and females separately. We identified a total of five loci associated with the serum sodium concentration of which the locus on chromosome 14, containing only one known gene (Nalcn), showed the strongest correlation. Within this locus three different haplotypes could be distinguished, which associated with different average serum sodium levels. The association of Nalcn with sodium levels was confirmed by analysis of heterozygous Nalcn knockout mice, which displayed hypernatremia compared with wild-type littermates. Our study demonstrates that Nalcn associates with serum sodium concentrations in mice and indicates that Nalcn is an important novel player in osmoregulation.},

Here we describe the positional cloning and characterization of a new mouse mutation isolated in an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea ({ENU}) forward mutagenesis screen for animals with enhanced locomotor activity. This allele, Lightweight (Lwt), disrupts the homolog of the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) unc-79 gene. While Lwt/Lwt homozygotes are perinatal lethal, Lightweight heterozygotes are dramatically hypersensitive to acute ethanol exposure. Experiments in C. elegans demonstrate a conserved hypersensitivity to ethanol in unc-79 mutants and extend this observation to the related unc-80 mutant and nca-1;nca-2 double mutants. Lightweight heterozygotes also exhibit an altered response to the anesthetic isoflurane, reminiscent of unc-79 invertebrate mutant phenotypes. Consistent with our initial mapping results, Lightweight heterozygotes are mildly hyperactive when exposed to a novel environment and are smaller than wild-type animals. In addition, Lightweight heterozygotes exhibit increased food consumption yet have a leaner body composition. Interestingly, Lightweight heterozygotes voluntarily consume more ethanol than wild-type littermates. The acute hypersensitivity to and increased voluntary consumption of ethanol observed in Lightweight heterozygous mice in combination with the observed hypersensitivity to ethanol in C. elegans unc-79, unc-80, and nca-1;nca-2 double mutants suggests a novel conserved pathway that might influence alcohol-related behaviors in humans.},

	abstract = {Background A syndrome of profound hypotonia, intellectual disability, intrauterine growth retardation with subsequent failure to thrive, dyskinesia and epilepsy was diagnosed in Bedouin Israeli families. Mild dysmorphism was evident: plagiocephaly, broad forehead with prominent nose, smooth philtrum and congenital esotropia. We set out to decipher the molecular basis of this syndrome.
Methods Genome-wide linkage analysis and fine mapping were done. Whole exome sequencing data were filtered for candidate variants within locus. Validation and segregation of the mutation was assayed via Sanger sequencing. {UNC}80 expression pattern was analysed through reverse transcription {PCR}.
Results Homozygosity mapping followed by fine mapping identified a 7.5 Mb disease-associated locus (logarithm of odds score 3.5) on chromosome 2. Whole exome and Sanger sequencing identified a single homozygous nonsense mutation within this locus, segregating within the families as expected for recessive heredity and not found in a homozygous state in 150 Bedouin controls: c.151C{\textgreater}T, p.(R51*) in {UNC}80.
Conclusions The syndrome described is caused by a mutation in {UNC}80, truncating most of the 3258 amino acids highly conserved encoded protein, that has no known motifs. {UNC}80 bridges between {UNC}79 and the cation channel {NALCN}, enabling {NALCN}'s role in basal Na+ leak conductance in neurons, essential for neuronal function. The phenotype caused by the {UNC}80 mutation resembles that previously described for homozygous {NALCN} mutations.},

We report 3 children (2 siblings) with compound heterozygous mutations in {NALCN} associated with developmental impairment, hypotonia, and central sleep-disordered breathing causing apneas. Supplemental oxygen normalized the respiratory rhythm. {NALCN} mutations have been previously reported to cause severe hypotonia, speech impairment, and cognitive delay as well as infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy and facial dysmorphism. Nonsynonymous changes in the 2 affected extracellular loops may be responsible for the deleterious effect on the stability of the respiratory rhythm.

	abstract = {\textbf{\textit{Background/Aims:}} Uterine contractility is controlled by electrical signals generated by myometrial smooth muscle cells. Because aberrant electrical signaling may cause inefficient uterine contractions and poor reproductive outcomes, there is great interest in defining the ion channels that regulate uterine excitability. In human myometrium, the Na$^{\textrm{+}}$ leak channel, non-selective ({NALCN}) contributes to a gadolinium-sensitive, Na$^{\textrm{+}}$-dependent leak current. The aim of this study was to determine the role of {NALCN} in regulating uterine excitability and examine its involvement in parturition. \textbf{\textit{Methods:}} Wildtype C57BL/6J mice underwent timed-mating and {NALCN} uterine expression was measured at several time points across pregnancy including pregnancy days 7, 10, 14, 18 and 19. Sharp electrode current clamp was used to measure uterine excitability at these same time points. To determine {NALCN}’s contribution to myometrial excitability and pregnancy outcomes, we created smooth-muscle-specific {NALCN} knockout mice by crossing {NALCN}\textit{fx/fx} mice with myosin heavy chain Cre ({MHC}\textit{{CreeGFP}}) mice. Parturition outcomes were assessed by observation via surveillance video recording cre control, flox control, {smNALCN}$^{\textrm{+/-}}$, and {smNALCN}$^{\textrm{-/-}}$ mice. Myometrial excitability was compared between pregnancy day 19 flox controls and {smNALCN}$^{\textrm{-/-}}$ mice. \textbf{\textit{Results:}} We found that in the mouse uterus, {NALCN} protein levels were high early in pregnancy, decreased in mid and late pregnancy, and then increased in labor and postpartum. Sharp electrode current clamp recordings of mouse longitudinal myometrial samples from pregnancy days 7, 10, 14, 18, and 19 revealed day-dependent increases in burst duration and interval and decreases in spike density. {NALCN} smooth muscle knockout mice had reduced myometrial excitability exemplified by shortened action potential bursts, and an increased rate of abnormal labor, including prolonged and dysfunctional labor. \textbf{\textit{Conclusions:}} Together, our findings demonstrate that the Na$^{\textrm{+}}$ conducting channel {NALCN} contributes to the myometrial action potential waveform and is important for successful labor outcomes.},

Here, we document two individuals with early onset hypotonia with poor feeding and intellectual disability who were compatible with a diagnosis of {IHPRF}1. The two patients had bi-allelic mutations in {NALCN} through two different genetic mechanisms: Patient 1 had bi-allelic splice site mutations, that is c.1267-2A{\textgreater}G, derived from heterozygous parents, while Patient 2 had a partial maternal uniparental isodisomy that harbored a frameshift mutation, that is c.2022\_2023delAT, in chromosome 13 that was detected through a dedicated algorithm for homozygosity data mapping in whole exome sequencing. The delineation of the exact pattern of inheritance provided vital information regarding the risk of recurrence. In animal models with Nalcn mutations, two behavioral phenotypes, that are, postnatal dyspnea and sleep disturbance, have been reported. Our observations of the two patients with postnatal dyspnea and one patient with sleep disturbance support an association between these two behavioral phenotypes and {NALCN} mutations in humans. The routine use of a detection algorithm for homozygosity data mapping might improve the diagnostic yields of next-generation sequencing.},

The older sibling died suddenly without a known etiology after evaluation but before molecular diagnosis. An international collaboration originating from a resource limited Caribbean island facilitated molecular diagnosis. Due to its small population, geographical isolation, and low socioeconomic status, the island lacks many specialty medical services, including clinical genetics. Descriptions of genetic disorders affecting individuals of Afro-Caribbean ancestry are rarely reported in the medical literature. Diagnosis of {IHPRF}1 is important, as individuals with biallelic pathogenic {NALCN} variants are severely affected and potentially are at risk for cardiorespiratory arrest.

	abstract = {{NALCN} (Na+  leak channel, non-selective) is a conserved, voltage-insensitive cation channel that regulates resting membrane potential and neuronal excitability. {UNC}79 and {UNC}80 are key regulators of the channel function. However, the behavioral effects of the channel complex are not entirely clear and the neurons in which the channel functions remain to be identified. In a forward genetic screen for C. elegans mutants with defective avoidance response to the plant hormone methyl salicylate ({MeSa}), we isolated multiple loss-of-function mutations in unc-80 and unc-79. C. elegans {NALCN} mutants exhibited similarly defective {MeSa} avoidance. Interestingly, {NALCN}, unc-80 and unc-79 mutants all showed wild type-like responses to other attractive or repelling odorants, suggesting that {NALCN} does not broadly affect odor detection or related forward and reversal behaviors. To understand in which neurons the channel functions, we determined the identities of a subset of unc-80-expressing neurons. We found that unc-79 and unc-80 are expressed and function in overlapping neurons, which verified previous assumptions. Neuron-specific transgene rescue and knockdown experiments suggest that the command interneurons {AVA} and {AVE} and the anterior guidepost neuron {AVG} can play a sufficient role in mediating unc-80 regulation of the {MeSa} avoidance. Though primarily based on genetic analyses, our results further imply that {MeSa} might activate {NALCN} by direct or indirect actions. Altogether, we provide an initial look into the key neurons in which the {NALCN} channel complex functions and identify a novel function of the channel in regulating C. elegans reversal behavior through command interneurons.},

Cch1 is homologous to the pore-forming α1 subunit of animal voltage-gated Ca2+ channels ({VGCCs}) and sodium leak channels nonselective ({NALCNs}), whereas Mid1 is a membrane-associated protein similar to the regulatory α2/δ subunit of {VGCCs} and the regulatory subunit of {NALCNs}. Although the physiological roles of Cch1/Mid1 channels are known, their molecular regulation remains elusive, including subunit interactions regulating channel functionality. Herein, we identify amino acid residues involved in interactions between the pore-forming Cch1 subunit and the essential regulatory Mid1 subunit of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In vitro mutagenesis followed by functional assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments reveal that three residues present in a specific extracellular loop in the repeat {III} region of Cch1 are required for interaction with Mid1, and that one essential Mid1 residue is required for interaction with Cch1. Importantly, these residues are necessary for Ca2+ channel activity and are highly conserved in fungal and animal counterparts. We discuss that this unique subunit interaction-based regulatory mechanism for Cch1 differs from that of {VGCCs}/{NALCNs}.},

	abstract = {Parkinson’s disease ({PD}) is a debilitating movement disorder often accompanied by neuropsychiatric symptoms that stem from the loss of dopaminergic function in the basal ganglia and altered neurotransmission more generally. Akinesia, postural instability, tremors and frozen gait constitute the major motor disturbances, whereas neuropsychiatric symptoms include altered circadian rhythms, disordered sleep, depression, psychosis and cognitive impairment. Evidence is emerging that the motor and neuropsychiatric symptoms may share etiologic factors. Calcium/ion channels ({CACNA}1C, {NALCN}), synaptic proteins ({SYNJ}1) and neuronal {RNA}-binding proteins ({RBFOX}1) are among the risk genes that are common to {PD} and various psychiatric disorders. The Na+ leak-current channel ({NALCN}) is the focus of this review because it has been implicated in dystonia, regulation of movement, cognitive impairment, sleep and circadian rhythms. It regulates the resting membrane potential in neurons, mediates pace-making activity, participates in synaptic vesicle recycling and is functionally co-localized to the endoplasmic reticulum ({ER})—several of the major processes adversely affected in {PD}. Here, we summarize the literature on mechanisms and pathways that connect the motor and neuropsychiatric symptoms of {PD} with a focus on recurring relationships to the {NALCN}. It is hoped that the various connections outlined here will stimulate further discussion, suggest additional areas for exploration and ultimately inspire novel treatment strategies.},

	abstract = {Appearance of highly sodium selective voltage-gated sodium channels with rapid gating kinetics was a limiting factor in the evolution of nervous systems. Two rounds of domain duplications in a basal eukaryote generated a common ion channel template that is shared amongst voltage-gated sodium (Nav1, Nav2) and calcium channels (Cav1, Cav2, Cav3). Conservation of intron splice junctions in the first domain, including a rare U12-type from the minor spliceosome provides support for a shared, distant heritage of sodium and calcium channels. The consequences of a 4x6 transmembrane domain configuration is the emergence of a uniquely asymmetrical domains with a shared architecture. This configuration permits a highly changeable ion selectivity from calcium to sodium ion selectivity by means of a single lysine residue change in the high field strength site of the ion selectivity filter. A non-selective, and slowly-gating Nav2 channel appearing in single cell eukaryotes before the split of animals and fungi, evolved into ten Nav1.x channel genes specialized for vertebrate tissues. A close kinship is evident in the sharing of most intron splice junctions between Nav2 and Nav1 channels. Multicellularity and the appearance of nervous systems was an impetus for Nav1 channels to adapt to high sodium ion selectivity and fast ion gating. Specific nervous system adaptations include a capacity for modulation by protein kinase phosphorylation and tethering elements to protein assemblies in First Initial Segments and nodes of Ranvier. Associated with the novel niches filled by Nav1 channels in metazoans is the convergent evolution of completely differing sets of accessory Navbeta subunits in different animal phyla or sub-phyla. Navbeta subunits contribute to trafficking and stabilization of Nav1 channels to specialized nerve membrane locales. Navbeta subunit isoforms serve as cell adhesion molecules tethering to elements to the extracellular matrix, and contribute to developmental functions such as nerve outgrowth and axon migration.},

Leak currents were generated by the weakening of gigaohm patch seals by artificial membrane rupture using the {ZAP} function on the patch clamp amplifier. Surprisingly, we found that leak currents generated from the weakened membrane/glass seal can be surprisingly stable and exhibit behavior that is consistent with a sodium leak current derived from an expressible channel. Leaky patch currents differing by 10 fold in size were similarly reduced in size when external sodium ions were replaced with the large monovalent ion {NMDG}+. Leaky patch currents increased when external Ca2+ (1.2 {mM}) was lowered to 0.1 {mM} and were inhibited ({\textgreater}40\% to {\textgreater}90\%) with 10 µM Gd3+, 100 µM La3+, 1 {mM} Co2+ or 1 {mM} Cd2+. Leaky patch currents were relatively insensitive ({\textless}30\%) to 1 {mM} Ni2+ and exhibited a variable amount of block with 1 {mM} verapamil and were insensitive to 100 µM mibefradil or 100 µM nifedipine. We hypothesize that the rapid changes in leak current size in response to changing external cations or drugs relates to their influences on the membrane seal adherence and the electro-osmotic flow of mobile cations channeling in crevices of a particular pore size in the interface between the negatively charged patch electrode and the lipid membrane. Observed sodium leak conductance currents in weak patch seals are reproducible between the electrode glass interface with cell membranes, artificial lipid or Sylgard rubber.},

In these cells, several studies previously showed that extracellular sodium (Na+) removal resulted in a negative shift of the resting membrane potential ({RMP}) and a subsequent inhibition of the spontaneous firing of action potentials, suggesting the contribution of a Na+ background conductance. Here, we show that the Na+ leak channel {NALCN} conducts a Ca2+- Gd3+-sensitive and {TTX}-resistant Na+ background conductance in the {GH}3 cell line, a cell model of pituitary endocrine cells. {NALCN} knockdown hyperpolarized the {RMP}, altered {GH}3 cell electrical properties and inhibited prolactin secretion. Conversely, the overexpression of {NALCN} depolarized the {RMP}, also reshaping the electrical properties of {GH}3 cells. Overall, our results indicate that {NALCN} is functional in {GH}3 cells and involved in endocrine cell excitability as well as in hormone secretion. Indeed, the {GH}3 cell line suitably models native pituitary cells that display a similar Na+ background conductance and appears as a proper cellular model to study the role of {NALCN} in cellular excitability.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Midbrain dopamine ({DA}) neurons are slow pacemakers that maintain extracellular {DA} levels. During the interspike intervals, subthreshold slow depolarization underlies autonomous pacemaking and determines its rate. However, the ion channels that determine slow depolarization are unknown. Here we show that {TRPC}3 and {NALCN} channels together form sustained inward currents responsible for the slow depolarization of nigral {DA} neurons. Specific {TRPC}3 channel blockade completely blocked {DA} neuron pacemaking, but the pacemaking activity in {TRPC}3 knock-out ({KO}) mice was perfectly normal, suggesting the presence of compensating ion channels. Blocking {NALCN} channels abolished pacemaking in both {TRPC}3 {KO} and wild-type mice. The {NALCN} current and {mRNA} and protein expression are increased in {TRPC}3 {KO} mice, indicating that {NALCN} compensates for {TRPC}3 currents. In normal conditions, {TRPC}3 and {NALCN} contribute equally to slow depolarization. Therefore, we conclude that {TRPC}3 and {NALCN} are two major leak channels that drive robust pacemaking in nigral {DA} neurons.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The resting Na$^{\textrm{+}}$-leak conductance is a major mechanism by which neurons maintain their {RMPs} above E$_{\textrm{K}}$. In the hippocampal neurons, the {TTX}-insensitive, voltage-independent Na$^{\textrm{+}}$ leak is mediated by the {NALCN} cation channel. Extracellular Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$ (Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$$_{\textrm{e}}$) also controls the sizes of {NALCN} current (I$_{\textrm{{NALCN}}}$) in a G-protein-dependent fashion. The molecular identities of the basal Na$^{\textrm{+}}$ conductances and their regulation in other regions in the central nervous system and in the peripheral nervous system are less established. Here we show that neurons cultured from mouse cortices, ventral tegmental area, spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia all have a {NALCN}-dependent basal Na$^{\textrm{+}}$-leak conductance that is absent in {NALCN} knockout mice. Like in hippocampal neurons, a decrease in [Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$]$_{\textrm{e}}$ increases I$_{\textrm{{NALCN}}}$. Using {shRNA} knockdown, we show that the regulation of I$_{\textrm{{NALCN}}}$ by Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$$_{\textrm{e}}$ in neurons requires the Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$-sensing G-protein-coupled receptor {CaSR}. Surprisingly, the functional coupling from [Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$]$_{\textrm{e}}$ to {NALCN} requires {CaSR}’s distal C-terminal domain that is dispensable for the receptor’s ability to couple [Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$]$_{\textrm{e}}$ to its canonical signaling targets such as {PLC} and {MAPK}. In addition, several epilepsy-associated human {CaSR} mutations, though sparing the receptor’s ability to sense Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$$_{\textrm{e}}$ to maintain systemic [Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$], disrupt the ability of {CaSR} to regulate {NALCN}. These findings uncover a unique mechanism by which {CaSR} regulates neuronal excitability via {NALCN} in the central and peripheral nervous system.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The K2P channels are regulated by a wide variety of voltage-independent factors. Basic physicochemical parameters (e.g., {pH}, temperature, membrane stretch) and also several intracellular signaling pathways substantially and specifically modulate the different members of the six K2P channel subfamilies ({TWIK}, {TREK}, {TASK}, {TALK}, {THIK}, and {TRESK}). The deep implication in diverse physiological processes, the circumscribed expression pattern of the different channels, and the interesting pharmacological profile brought the K2P channel family into the spotlight.

	abstract = {Whilst the phenomenon of an electrical resting membrane potential ({RMP}) is a central tenet of biology, it is nearly always discussed as a phenomenon that facilitates the propagation of action potentials in excitable tissue, muscle and nerve. However, as ion channel research shifts beyond these tissues, it became clear that the {RMP} is a feature of virtually all cells studied. The {RMP} is maintained by the cell’s compliment of ion channels. Transcriptome sequencing is increasingly revealing that equally rich compliments of ion channels exist in both excitable and non-excitable tissue. In this review, we discuss a range of critical roles that the {RMP} has in a variety of cell types beyond the action potential. Whereas most biologists would perceive that the {RMP} is primarily about excitability, the data show that in fact excitability is only a small part of it. Emerging evidence show that a dynamic membrane potential is critical for many other processes including cell cycle, cell-volume control, proliferation, muscle contraction (even in the absence of an action potential) and wound healing. Modulation of the {RMP} is therefore a potential target for many new drugs targeting a range of diseases and biological functions from cancer through to wound healing and is likely to be key to the development of successful stem cell therapies.},

These transmembrane proteins are involved in a wide range of physiological processes, such as membrane excitability, rhythmical activity, intracellular signalling, etc. Information about actual diversity and phylogenetic relationships of {FVCCs} across the eukaryotic tree of life is scarce. We for the first time performed a taxonomically broad phylogenetic analysis of 277 {FVCC} sequences from a variety of eukaryotes and showed that many groups of eukaryotic organisms have their own clades of {FVCCs}. Moreover, the number of {FVCC} lineages in several groups of unicellular eukaryotes is comparable to that in animals. Based on the primary structure of {FVCC} sequences, we characterised their functional determinants (selectivity filter, voltage sensor, Nav-like inactivation gates, Cavbeta-interaction motif, and calmodulin-binding region) and mapped them on the obtained phylogeny. This allowed uncovering of lineage-specific structural gains and losses in the course of {FVCC} evolution and identification of ancient structural features of these channels. Our results indicate that the ancestral {FVCC} was voltage-sensitive, possessed a Cav-like selectivity filter, Nav-like inactivation gates, calmodulin-binding motifs and did not bear the structure for Cavbeta-binding.},

The sodium leak channel ({NALCN}), a non-selective cation channel, mediates the background Na+ leak conductance and controls neuronal excitability and rhythmic behaviors. Here, we show that increases of {NALCN} expression and function in dorsal root ganglion ({DRG}) and dorsal spinal cord contribute to chronic constriction injury ({CCI})-induced neuropathic pain in rodents. {NALCN} current and neuronal excitability in acutely isolated {DRG} neurons and spinal cord slices of rats were increased after {CCI} which were decreased to normal levels by {NALCN}-{siRNA}. Accordingly, pain-related symptoms were significantly alleviated by {NALCN}-{siRNA}-mediated {NALCN} knockdown and completely prevented by {NALCN}-{shRNA}-mediated {NALCN} knockdown in rats or by conditional {NALCN} knockout in mice. Our results indicate that increases in {NALCN} expression and function contribute to {CCI}-induced neuronal sensitization; therefore, {NALCN} may be a novel molecular target for control of neuropathic pain.},

	abstract = {Unusually among {ATP}-binding cassette proteins, the sulfonylurea receptor ({SUR}) acts as a channel regulator. {ATP}-sensitive potassium channels are octameric complexes composed of four pore-forming Kir6.2 subunits and four regulatory {SUR} subunits. Two different genes encode {SUR}1 ({ABCC}8) and {SUR}2 ({ABCC}9), with the latter being differentially spliced to give {SUR}2A and {SUR}2B, which differ only in their C-terminal 42 amino acids. {ATP}-sensitive potassium channels containing these different {SUR}2 isoforms are differentially modulated by {MgATP}, with Kir6.2/{SUR}2B being activated more than Kir6.2/{SUR}2A. We show here that purified {SUR}2B has a lower {ATPase} activity and a 10-fold lower Km for {MgATP} than {SUR}2A. Similarly, the isolated nucleotide-binding domain ({NBD}) 2 of {SUR}2B was less active than that of {SUR}2A. We further found that the {NBDs} of {SUR}2B interact, and that the activity of full-length {SUR} cannot be predicted from that of either the isolated {NBDs} or {NBD} mixtures. Notably, deletion of the last 42 amino acids from {NBD}2 of {SUR}2 resulted in {ATPase} activity resembling that of {NBD}2 of {SUR}2A rather than that of {NBD}2 of {SUR}2B: this might indicate that these amino acids are responsible for the lower {ATPase} activity of {SUR}2B and the isolated {NBD}2 of {SUR}2B. We suggest that the lower {ATPase} activity of {SUR}2B may result in enhanced duration of the {MgADP}-bound state, leading to channel activation.},

These five subunit membrane proteins have two allosteric (transmitter) binding sites and a distant ion channel domain. Occupation of the binding sites by agonist molecules transiently increases the probability that the channel is ion-permeable. Recent experiments show that the Monod, Wyman and Changeux formalism for allosteric proteins, originally developed for haemoglobin, is an excellent model for acetylcholine receptors. By using mutations and single-channel electrophysiology, the gating equilibrium constants for receptors with zero, one or two bound agonist molecules, and the agonist association and dissociation rate constants from both the closed- and open-channel conformations, have been estimated experimentally. The change in affinity for each transmitter molecule between closed and open conformations provides ∼–5.1 kcal mol−1 towards the global gating isomerization of the protein.},

	abstract = {To determine how intracellular Ca2+ and membrane voltage regulate the gating of large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ ({BK}) channels, we examined the steady-state and kinetic properties of {mSlo}1 ionic and gating currents in the presence and absence of Ca2+ over a wide range of voltage. The activation of unliganded {mSlo}1 channels can be accounted for by allosteric coupling between voltage sensor activation and the closed (C) to open (O) conformational change (Horrigan, F.T., and R.W. Aldrich. 1999. J. Gen. Physiol. 114:305–336; Horrigan, F.T., J. Cui, and R.W. Aldrich. 1999. J. Gen. Physiol. 114:277–304). In 0 Ca2+, the steady-state gating charge-voltage ({QSS}-V) relationship is shallower and shifted to more negative voltages than the conductance-voltage ({GK}-V) relationship. Calcium alters the relationship between Q-V and G-V, shifting both to more negative voltages such that they almost superimpose in 70 μM Ca2+. This change reflects a differential effect of Ca2+ on voltage sensor activation and channel opening. Ca2+ has only a small effect on the fast component of {ON} gating current, indicating that Ca2+ binding has little effect on voltage sensor activation when channels are closed. In contrast, open probability measured at very negative voltages (less than −80 {mV}) increases more than 1,000-fold in 70 μM Ca2+, demonstrating that Ca2+ increases the C-O equilibrium constant under conditions where voltage sensors are not activated. Thus, Ca2+ binding and voltage sensor activation act almost independently, to enhance channel opening. This dual-allosteric mechanism can reproduce the steady-state behavior of {mSlo}1 over a wide range of conditions, with the assumption that activation of individual Ca2+ sensors or voltage sensors additively affect the energy of the C-O transition and that a weak interaction between Ca2+ sensors and voltage sensors occurs independent of channel opening. By contrast, macroscopic {IK} kinetics indicate that Ca2+ and voltage dependencies of C-O transition rates are complex, leading us to propose that the C-O conformational change may be described by a complex energy landscape.},

To investigate the subunit interactions that occur during {CNG} channel activation, we have used tandem {cDNA} constructs of the rod {CNG} channel to generate heteromultimeric channels composed of wild-type and mutant subunits. We introduced point mutations that affect channel activation: 1) D604M, which alters the relative ability of agonists to promote the allosteric conformational change(s) associated with channel opening, and 2) T560A, which primarily affects the initial binding affinity for {cGMP}, and to a lesser extent, the allosteric transition. At saturating concentrations of agonist, heteromultimeric channels were intermediate between wild-type and mutant homomultimers in agonist efficacy and apparent affinity for {cGMP}, {cIMP}, and {cAMP}, consistent with a model for the allosteric transition involving a concerted conformational change in all of the channel subunits. Results were also consistent with a model involving independent transitions in two or three, but not one or four, of the channel subunits. The behavior of the heterodimers implies that the channel stoichiometry is some multiple of 2 and is consistent with a tetrameric quaternary structure for the functional channel complex. Steady-state dose-response relations for homomultimeric and heteromultimeric channels were well fit by a Monod, Wyman, and Changeux model with a concerted allosteric opening transition stabilized by binding of agonist.},

	abstract = {How the mole-rat lost its pain
Pain alerts our bodies that something is amiss and typically we stop the pain-causing activity. Numerous species of plants and prey animals take advantage of this response by producing pain-causing substances that are released during predation attempts. In turn, species that encounter these substances often evolve ways of turning off the pain-producing mechanism. Eigenbrod et al. searched {RNA} transcripts in eight species of subterranean rodents related to pain-resistant naked mole-rats. They found multiple changes to ion channels involved in pain across the different species. Understanding such adaptations could elucidate pain mechanisms and help us develop approaches for pain relief.
Science, this issue p. 852
Noxious substances, called algogens, cause pain and are used as defensive weapons by plants and stinging insects. We identified four previously unknown instances of algogen-insensitivity by screening eight African rodent species related to the naked mole-rat with the painful substances capsaicin, acid (hydrogen chloride, {pH} 3.5), and allyl isothiocyanate ({AITC}). Using {RNA} sequencing, we traced the emergence of sequence variants in transduction channels, like transient receptor potential channel {TRPA}1 and voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7, that accompany algogen insensitivity. In addition, the {AITC}-insensitive highveld mole-rat exhibited overexpression of the leak channel {NALCN} (sodium leak channel, nonselective), ablating {AITC} detection by nociceptors. These molecular changes likely rendered highveld mole-rats immune to the stings of the Natal droptail ant. Our study reveals how evolution can be used as a discovery tool to find molecular mechanisms that shut down pain.
Molecular changes in ion channels shaped by noxious substances in plants and insects silence pain in different species of mole-rat.

Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the 3-D structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence, the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8, has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even where no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, {AlphaFold}, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction ({CASP}14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experiment in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of {AlphaFold} is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

In ion channels, the function of these variants can be studied with great precision using standard electrophysiology, but this approach is typically labor intensive and low throughput. Here, we establish a high-throughput protocol to conduct functional and pharmacological investigations of {ncAA}-containing {hASIC}1a (human acid-sensing ion channel 1a) variants in transiently transfected mammalian cells. We introduce three different photocrosslinking {ncAAs} into 103 positions and assess the function of the resulting 309 variants with automated patch-clamp ({APC}). We demonstrate that the approach is efficient and versatile, as it is amenable to assessing even complex pharmacological modulation by peptides. The data show that the acidic pocket is a major determinant for current decay and live-cell crosslinking provides insight into the {hASIC}1a-psalmotoxin-1 interaction. Further, we provide evidence that the protocol can be applied to other ion channels, such as P2X2 and {GluA}2 receptors. We therefore anticipate the approach to enable future {APC}-based studies of {ncAA}-containing ion channels in mammalian cells.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Acid-sensing ion channels ({ASICs}) are proton-gated cation channels that contribute to neurotransmission, as well as initiation of pain and neuronal death following ischemic stroke. As such, there is a great interest in understanding the in vivo regulation of {ASICs}, especially by endogenous neuropeptides that potently modulate {ASICs}. The most potent endogenous {ASIC} modulator known to date is the opioid neuropeptide big dynorphin ({BigDyn}). {BigDyn} is up-regulated in chronic pain and increases {ASIC}-mediated neuronal death during acidosis. Understanding the mechanism and site of action of {BigDyn} on {ASICs} could thus enable the rational design of compounds potentially useful in the treatment of pain and ischemic stroke. To this end, we employ a combination of electrophysiology, voltage-clamp fluorometry, synthetic {BigDyn} analogs, and noncanonical amino acid-mediated photocrosslinking. We demonstrate that {BigDyn} binding results in an {ASIC}1a closed resting conformation that is distinct from open and desensitized states induced by protons. Using alanine-substituted {BigDyn} analogs, we find that the {BigDyn} modulation of {ASIC}1a is primarily mediated through electrostatic interactions of basic amino acids in the {BigDyn} N terminus. Furthermore, neutralizing acidic amino acids in the {ASIC}1a extracellular domain reduces {BigDyn} effects, suggesting a binding site at the acidic pocket. This is confirmed by photocrosslinking using the noncanonical amino acid azidophenylalanine. Overall, our data define the mechanism of how {BigDyn} modulates {ASIC}1a, identify the acidic pocket as the binding site for {BigDyn}, and thus highlight this cavity as an important site for the development of {ASIC}-targeting therapeutics.},

We describe here a class of closely related {ATP}-binding proteins, from several bacterial species, which are associated with a variety of cellular functions including membrane transport, cell division, nodulation in Rhizobium and haemolysin export. These proteins comprise a family of structurally and functionally related subunits which share a common evolutionary origin, bind {ATP} and probably serve to couple {ATP} hydrolysis to each of these biological processes. This finding suggests a specific role for {ATP} in cell division, nodulation during nitrogen fixation and protein export, and allows us to assign a probable function to one of the protein components from each of these systems.},
