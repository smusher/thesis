First of all, thank you Fran for your endless well of knowledge, and your support and encouragement throughout my time in your lab.
Your enthusiasm for science will continue to inspire me, and I will always be grateful for your patience.
Thank you Mike, for taking on a graduate student who had never patched a cell before and infusing me with your love for ion channels.
I couldn't have asked for a better friend and colleague.

Thank you to the Ashcroft lab, past and present, for your companionship, expertise, and hard work - Raul, Idoia, Natascia, Lizzie, Gregor, Will.
It has been a privilege to work and learn alongside you.
Thank you to the other members of the ion channel journal club for putting up with my ramblings and contributing some of your own.
Harvey, Brad, Max - it's been a pleasure falling back in love with Oxford with you guys.

Thank you Meg for your constant support and for being a shoulder to lean on whenever I have needed it.
Finally, thank you to my family - Mum, Dad, I will never be able to fully express my gratitude for everything you have done to get me here.
